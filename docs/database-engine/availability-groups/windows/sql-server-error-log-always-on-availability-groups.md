# SQL Server error log (Always On Availability Groups)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  The SQL Server error log reports events affecting Always On Availability Groups, such as:  
  
-   Communication with the Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster  
  
-   State transitions of availability replicas  
  
-   State transitions of availability databases  
  
-   Connectivity state of availability databases between primary and secondary replicas  
  
-   Statuses of the availability group endpoints  
  
-   Statuses of the availability group listeners  
  
-   Lease status between the SQL Server resource DLL (running in the WSFC cluster) and the SQL Server instance (for more information, see [How It Works: SQL Server Always On lease timeout](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/psssql/archive/2012/09/07/how-it-works-sql-server-alwayson-lease-timeout.aspx))  
  
-   Error events in the availability group  


The following symptoms should lead to review of the SQL Server error log:  

-   Cannot access availability databases  
  
-   Unexpected availability group failover  
  
-   Availability group in the Resolving state unexpectedly  
  
-   Availability group in an indeterminate state
