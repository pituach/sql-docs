# SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access (AccessToSQL)
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Access is a tool for migrating databases from [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] Access versions 97 through 2010 to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 / [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2008 / [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2012 / [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2014 / [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2016 / [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2017 on Windows and Linux (Preview) / [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] Azure SQL DB. SSMA for Access converts Access database objects to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL database objects, loads those objects into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL, and then migrates data from Access to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL.  
  
This documentation introduces you to SSMA for Access and provides step-by-step instructions for migrating Access databases to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or SQL Azure and information about issues that might occur after migration.
