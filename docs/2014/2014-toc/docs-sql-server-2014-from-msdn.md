# Documentation for SQL Server 2014 is moving to Docs

This article describes the upcoming move of the Microsoft's SQL Server 2014 documentation articles. This article is being written in late April 2018, and the move will occur before July 2018.

## Links to SQL Server 2014 documentation on MSDN

The following links are to the SQL Server 2014 documentation that Microsoft has stored on its *MSDN* website. Before July 2018, Microsoft will move these documentation articles to its new *Docs* website:

- *SQL Server 2014*
    - [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn197878(v=sql.10).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn197878(v=sql.10).aspx)

- *Books Online for SQL Server 2014*
    - [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms130214(v=sql.120).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms130214(v=sql.120).aspx)

MSDN is an initialism for *Microsoft Developer Network*.


## Redirectors

The obsolete MSDN HTTP addresses will continue to work for at least a couple years after the move. Redirectors will intercept the MSDN requests, and will forward them with their new corresponding address on Docs. However, after the move the following items will be true:

- It will be better to work with the new HTTP addresses that navigate directly to Docs.
- The Bing and Google crawlers will start delist and bypass the old MSDN addresses.


## After the move

After the move to *Docs*, the address of the root SQL Server 2014 documentation article will be:

- [https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/?view=sql-server-2014](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/?view=sql-server-2014)
