# Create a Model (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], create a model to contain model objects.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
### To create a model  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **System Administration**.  
  
2.  On the **Model View** page, from the menu bar, point to **Manage** and click **Models**.  
  
3.  On the **Model Maintenance** page, click **Add model**.  
  
4.  In the **Model name** box, type the name of the model.  
  
5.  Optionally, select **Create entity with same name as model** to create an entity with the same name as the model.  
  
6.  Optionally, select **Create explicit hierarchy with same name as model** to create an explicit hierarchy with the same name as the model. This option also enables the entity for collections.  
  
7.  Optionally, select **Mandatory hierarchy (all leaf members are included** to create the explicit hierarchy as a mandatory hierarchy.  
  
8.  Click **Save model**.
