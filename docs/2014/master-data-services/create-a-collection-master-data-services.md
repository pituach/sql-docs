# Create a Collection (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], create a collection when you want to create flat lists of leaf and consolidated members. Collections do not need to include all members from the entity.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
-   You must have a minimum of **Update** permission to the collection model object for the entity.  
  
-   The entity must be enabled for explicit hierarchies and collections. For more information, see [Enable an Entity for Explicit Hierarchies and Collections &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](enable-an-entity-for-explicit-hierarchies-and-collections-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To create a collection  
  
1.  On the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] home page, from the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
2.  From the **Version** list, select a version.  
  
3.  Click **Explorer**.  
  
4.  From the menu bar, point to **Collections** and click *entity_name*.  
  
5.  Click **Add collection**.  
  
6.  On the **Details** tab, in the **Name** box, type a name for the collection.  
  
7.  In the **Code** box, type a unique code for the collection.  
  
8.  Optionally, in the **Description** box, type a description for the collection.  
  
9. Click **OK**.
