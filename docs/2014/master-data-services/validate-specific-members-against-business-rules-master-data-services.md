# Validate Specific Members against Business Rules (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], apply business rules selectively when you want to update or validate subsets of members against business rules.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to apply business rules to all members in a version of a model, see [Validate a Version against Business Rules &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](validate-a-version-against-business-rules-master-data-services.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
-   You must have a minimum of **Update** permission to the model object you are applying business rules to.  
  
### To apply business rules selectively  
  
1.  On the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] home page, from the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
2.  From the **Version** list, select a version.  
  
3.  Click **Explorer**.  
  
4.  From the menu bar, point to **Entities** and click the name of the entity that contains members you want to apply rules to.  
  
5.  Click **Apply business rules**. Business rules are applied only to the members displayed in the grid.
