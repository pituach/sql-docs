# Notifications (Master Data Services)
  [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] can be configured to send an email notification when business rule validation fails or the status of a model version changes.  
  
## How Notifications Are Sent  
 You configure notifications in [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../includes/ssmdscfgmgr-md.md)]. Notifications send email messages by using Database Mail on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] that hosts the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database. For more information about Database Mail, see [Database Mail Configuration Objects](../relational-databases/database-mail/database-mail-configuration-objects.md) in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.  
  
## When Notifications Are Sent  
 After notifications are configured, automated email notifications can be sent in the following instances.  
  
|Instance|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|Data fails business rule validation|Individual business rules must be configured to send email when an attribute value fails business rule validation. For more information, see [Configure Business Rules to Send Notifications &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](configure-business-rules-to-send-notifications-master-data-services.md).|  
|Model version status changes|Each time a model version's status changes, users that are model administrators receive notifications automatically. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../2014/master-data-services/administrators-master-data-services.md).|  
  
## System Settings  
 There are settings in [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../includes/ssmdscfgmgr-md.md)] that affect notifications. You can adjust these settings in [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../includes/ssmdscfgmgr-md.md)] or directly in the System Settings table in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database. For more information, see [System Settings &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../2014/master-data-services/system-settings-master-data-services.md).
