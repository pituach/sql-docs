# Consolidated Permissions (Master Data Services)
  Consolidated permissions apply to the attribute values for all consolidated members of an entity.  
  
 Consolidated permissions apply only to entities that are enabled for explicit hierarchies and collections.  
  
 **Notes:**  
  
-   Leaf permissions apply to the **Explorer** functional area of the user interface only.  
  
-   Permissions assigned to **Name** and **Code** attributes are not enforced.  
  
|Permission|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**Read-only**|Consolidated members are displayed but the user cannot add, remove, or change them.|  
|**Update**|Consolidated members are displayed and the user can add, remove, and change them.|  
|**Deny**|Consolidated members for the entity are not displayed.|  
  
## Attribute Permissions  
 Attribute permissions apply to the attributeâ€™s values for the specific entity. Users with only attribute permissions cannot add or remove members.
