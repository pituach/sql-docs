# Annotations (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], annotations are comments that you enter to provide details about transactions.  
  
 You can annotate a transaction to provide information about why an action was taken. You must select a transaction to add a related annotation. Annotations are displayed along with transactions in:  
  
-   The **Explorer** functional area of the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] web application.  
  
-   The **Version Management** functional area of the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] web application.  
  
-   The MDS [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)].
