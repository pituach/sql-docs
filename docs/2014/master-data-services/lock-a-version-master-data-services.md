# Lock a Version (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], lock a version of a model to prevent changes to the model's members and their attributes.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When a version is locked, model administrators can continue to add, edit, and remove members. Other users with permission to the model can view members only.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Version Management** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
-   The version's status must be **Open**.  
  
### To lock a version  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **Version Management**.  
  
2.  On the **Manage Versions** page, select the row for the version that you want to lock.  
  
3.  Click **Lock**.  
  
4.  In the confirmation dialog box, click **OK**.
