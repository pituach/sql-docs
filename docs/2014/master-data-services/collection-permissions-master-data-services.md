# Collection Permissions (Master Data Services)
  Collection permissions apply to all collections for an entity. You cannot give permission to a specific collection; permissions apply to all collections.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  These permissions apply to the **Explorer** functional area of the user interface only.  
  
|Permission|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**Read-only**|All collections and collection members are displayed.<br /><br /> The user cannot add or remove collections, and cannot add members to the collection or remove members from it.|  
|**Update**|All collections are displayed and the user can add and remove collections.<br /><br /> The user can also add and remove members from the collection.|  
|**Deny**|All collections for the entity are not displayed.|
