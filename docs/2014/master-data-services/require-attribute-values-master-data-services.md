# Require Attribute Values (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], require attribute values when you want to ensure your master data is complete.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Members that are missing domain-based attribute values are not displayed in derived hierarchies that are based on those relationships.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To require attribute values  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **System Administration**.  
  
2.  From the menu bar, point to **Manage** and click **Business Rules**.  
  
3.  On the **Business Rule Maintenance** page, from the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
4.  From the **Entity** list, select an entity.  
  
5.  From the **Member Type** list, select a type of member for the business rule to apply to.  
  
6.  From the **Attribute** list, select an attribute or leave the default of **All**.  
  
7.  Click **Add business rule**.  
  
8.  Click **Edit selected business rule**.  
  
9. In the **Components** pane, expand the **Actions** node.  
  
10. Click **is required** and drag it to the **THEN** pane's **Action** label.  
  
11. In the **Attributes** pane, click an attribute and drag it to the **Edit Action** pane's **Select attribute** label.  
  
12. In the **Edit Action** pane, click **Save item**.  
  
13. Click **Back**.  
  
14. Optionally, on the **Business Rules Maintenance** page, for the row that contains your business rule, double-click a cell in the **Name**, **Description**, or **Notification** column to update the value.  
  
15. Click **Publish business rules**.  
  
16. On the confirmation dialog box, click **OK**. The rule's status changes to **Active**.  
  
## Next Steps  
  
-   Apply business rules to data by following one of these procedures:
