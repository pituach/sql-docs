# Delete an Explicit Hierarchy (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], delete an explicit hierarchy when you no longer need it.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  When you delete an explicit hierarchy, all consolidated members in the hierarchy are deleted also. If you delete all explicit hierarchies for an entity, all collections for the entity are also deleted and the entity is no longer enabled for explicit hierarchies and collections.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To delete an explicit hierarchy  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **System Administration**.  
  
2.  On the **Model View** page, from the menu bar, point to **Manage** and click **Entities**.  
  
3.  On the **Entity Maintenance** page, from the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
4.  Select the row for the entity that contains the explicit hierarchy you want to delete.  
  
5.  Click **Edit selected entity**.  
  
6.  On the **Edit Entity** page, in the **Explicit Hierarchies** pane, click the explicit hierarchy you want to delete.  
  
7.  Click **Delete selected hierarchy**.  
  
8.  In the confirmation dialog box, click **OK**.
