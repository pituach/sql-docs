# Exclude a Business Rule (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], exclude a business rule when you do not want to delete the rule permanently, but you do not want to validate data against it.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To exclude a business rule  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **System Administration**.  
  
2.  From the menu bar, point to **Manage** and click **Business Rules**.  
  
3.  On the **Business Rule Maintenance** page, from the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
4.  From the **Entity** list, select an entity.  
  
5.  From the **Member Type** list, select a type of member.  
  
6.  From the **Attribute** list, select an attribute or leave the default of **All**.  
  
7.  In the grid, in the row for the business rule, select the check box in the **Exclude** column. The value in the **Status** column is **Exclusion pending**.  
  
8.  Click **Publish business rules**.  
  
9. In the confirmation dialog box, click **OK**. The value in the **Status** column is **Excluded**.
