# View File Status
  Source control maintains detailed status information on every source-controlled item. You can use this information to identify the current state of the file, and to create a status report on the item.  
  
 Status information includes:  
  
-   The identity of the user who has the file checked out.  
  
-   The latest version number of the selected file.  
  
-   The date on which the version was created.  
  
-   The user comment associated with any version.  
  
-   The paths to the projects with which the file is shared.  
  
### To view the status of an item  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select an item.  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **Source Control**, and click **SourceSafe Properties**.
