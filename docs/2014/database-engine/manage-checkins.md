# Manage Checkins
  To make changes to a source-controlled file available to other users, you must check in the file. When you check in a file, the version you have created is copied to the source control provider, becomes the latest version of the file, and is generally available to users who have the appropriate permissions.  
  
 Use [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to check in files. When you need to update the source control store periodically, but also need to maintain control over a set of files, you can specify that files you check in remain checked out to you.  
  
 The following table describes the topics in this section.

|[Check In Files](../../2014/database-engine/check-in-files.md)|Provides instructions on how to check in a file you have modified.|  
|[View a List of Modified Files](../../2014/database-engine/view-a-list-of-modified-files.md)|Explains how to display a list of modified files that you can check in together when you are finished working.|
