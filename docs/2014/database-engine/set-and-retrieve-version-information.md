# Set and Retrieve Version Information
  Version information includes the history and current status of a source-controlled file. For every source-controlled file, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual SourceSafe maintains a comprehensive history, so you can track the evolution of one or more files over time. You can also use this information to retrieve a local copy of any version of the file or to compare any two file versions.  
  
 The history of a file includes:  
  
-   The version number, which identifies its sequence among other versions of the same file.  
  
-   The action performed. Tracked operations include file creation, check in, and deletion.  
  
-   The user name of the person who performed an action involving the file.  
  
-   The date and time when the operation was performed.  
  
 Visual SourceSafe also maintains current status information on the currently loaded solution. This information provides a snapshot of the current state of the file, including:  
  
-   The identity of the user who has the file checked out.  
  
-   The latest version number of the selected file.  
  
-   The date when the version was created.  
  
-   The user comment associated with the version.  
  
-   The paths to the projects with which the file is shared.
