# open objects Server Configuration Option
  This option is still present in **sp_configure**, although its functionality has been disabled in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. (The setting has no effect.) In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the number of open database objects is managed dynamically and is limited only by the available memory. The **open objects** option available in **sp_configure** for backward compatibility with existing scripts.
