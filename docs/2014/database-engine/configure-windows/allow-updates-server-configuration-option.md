# allow updates Server Configuration Option
  This option is still present in the **sp_configure** stored procedure, although its functionality is unavailable in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The setting has no effect. Direct updates to the system tables are not supported.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureDontUse](../../includes/ssnotedepfuturedontuse-md.md)]  
  
 Changing the **allow updates** option will cause the RECONFIGURE statement to fail. Changes to the **allow updates** option should be removed from all scripts.
