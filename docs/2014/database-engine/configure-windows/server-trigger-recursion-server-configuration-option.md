# server trigger recursion Server Configuration Option
  Use the **server trigger recursion** option to specify whether to allow server-level triggers to fire recursively. When this option is set to 1 (ON), server-level triggers will be allowed to fire recursively. When set to 0 (OFF), server-level triggers cannot be fired recursively. Only direct recursion is prevented when the server trigger recursion option is set to 0 (OFF). (To disable indirect recursion, set the **nested triggers** option to 0.) The default value for this option is 1 (ON). The setting takes effect immediately (without a server restart).  
  
 For more information, see [Create Nested Triggers](../../relational-databases/triggers/create-nested-triggers.md).
