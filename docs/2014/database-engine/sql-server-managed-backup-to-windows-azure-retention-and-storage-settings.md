# SQL Server Managed Backup to Windows Azure - Retention and Storage Settings
  This topic describes the basic steps to configure [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for a database and to configure default settings for the instance. The topic also describes the steps necessary to pause and resume [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] services for the instance.  
  
 For a complete walkthrough of setting up [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] see [Setting up SQL Server Managed Backup to Windows Azure](../relational-databases/backup-restore/enable-sql-server-managed-backup-to-microsoft-azure.md) and [Setting up SQL Server Managed Backup to Windows Azure for Availability Groups](../../2014/database-engine/setting-up-sql-server-managed-backup-to-windows-azure-for-availability-groups.md).  
  
 
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   Do not enable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] on databases that are currently using maintenance plans or log shipping. For more information on interoperability and coexistence with other SQL Server features, see [SQL Server Managed Backup to Windows Azure: Interoperability and Coexistence](../../2014/database-engine/sql-server-managed-backup-to-windows-azure-interoperability-and-coexistence.md)  
  
###  <a name="Prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites  
  
-   SQL Server Agent should be running.  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    >  If SQL Server Agent is stopped for a period of time and then restarted, you may see an increased backup activity depending on the length of time elapsed between the stop and start of SQL Agent, and there might be a backlog of log backups waiting to run. Consider configuring SQL Server Agent to start automatically on start up.  
  
-   A Windows Azure storage account and a SQL Credential that stores the authentication information to the storage account should both be created before configuring [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)]. For more information see [Introduction to Key Components and Concepts](../relational-databases/backup-restore/sql-server-backup-to-url.md#intorkeyconcepts) section of the **SQL Server Backup to URL** topic, and [Lesson 2: Create a SQL Server Credential](../../2014/tutorials/lesson-2-create-a-sql-server-credential.md).  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] creates the necessary containers to store the backups. The container name is created using ‘machine name-instance name’ format. For AlwaysOn Availability Groups the container is named using the GUID of the availability group.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 To run the stored procedures that enable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)], you must be a  either a `System Administrator` or  member  in the **db_backupoperator** database role with **ALTER ANY CREDENTIAL** permissions, and `EXECUTE` permissions on the **sp_delete_backuphistory**, and `smart_admin.sp_backup_master_switch` stored procedures.  Stored procedures and functions used to review the existing settings typically require `Execute` permissions on the stored procedure and `Select` on the function respectively.  
  

  
###  <a name="Considerations"></a> Considerations for enabling [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for Databases and Instances  
 [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] can be enabled for individual databases separately or for the entire instance. The choices depend on the recoverability requirements for the databases on the instance, requirements for managing multiple databases and instances, and using Windows Azure storage strategically.  
  
#### Enabling [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] at the Database Level  
 If a database has specific requirements for backup and retention period (recoverability SLA) that is different from other databases on the instance, configure [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] at the database level for this database. Database level settings override instance level configuration settings. However both these options can be used together on the same instance. Following is a list of advantages and considerations when enabling [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] at the database level.  
  
-   More granular: Separate configuration settings for each database. Can support different retention periods for individual databases.  
  
-   Overrides instance level settings for the database.  
  
-   Can be used to reduce storage costs by selecting individual databases to be backed up.  
  
-   Requires managing each database  
  
#### Enabling [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] at the Instance Level with Default Settings  
 Use this setting if most of the databases in the instance have the same requirements for backup and retention policies, or if you want new database instances to automatically be backed up on creation. A few databases that are exception to the policy can still be configured individually. Following is a list of advantages and considerations when enabling [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] at the instance level.  
  
-   Automation at the instance level: Common settings applied to automatically for new databases added thereafter.  
  
-   New databases will be automatically backed up soon after they are created on the instances  
  
-   Can be applied to databases that have the same retention period requirements.  
  
-   You can still configure individual databases that require a different retention period even with [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] backup enabled at in instance level with default settings. You can also disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for databases if you do not intend to use Windows Azure storage for the backups.  
  
##  <a name="DatabaseConfigure"></a> Enable and Configure [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for a Database  
 The system stored procedure `smart_admin.sp_set_db_backup` is used to enable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for a specific database. When [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] is enabled for the first time on the database, the following information must be specified in addition to enabling [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)]:  
  
-   The name of the database.  
  
-   The retention period.  
  
-   SQL Credential used to authenticate to the Windows Azure storage account.  
  
-   Either specify not to encrypt using *@encryption_algorithm* = **NO_ENCRYPTION** or specify a supported encryption algorithm. For more information on encryption, see [Backup Encryption](../relational-databases/backup-restore/backup-encryption.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for database level configuration is only supported through Transact-SQL.  
  
 Once [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] is enabled for a database this information is persisted. If you are changing the configuration, only the database name and the setting you want to change is required, [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] retains the existing values for other parameters when not specified.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Before configuring [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] on a database it might be useful to existing configuration if any. The step to reviewing configuration settings for a database is explained later in this section.  
  
-   **Using Transact-SQL:**  
  
     If you are enabling [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for the first time, the required parameters are: *@database_name*, *@credential_name*, *@encryption_algorithm*,  *@enable_backup* The *@storage_url* parameter is optional. If you do not provide a value for  the @storage_url parameter, the value is derived using the storage account information from the SQL Credential. If you provide the storage URL you should only provide the URL for the root of the storage account, and must match the information in the SQL Credential you specified.  
  
    1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
    2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
    3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click `Execute`. This example enables [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for the database ‘TestDB’. The retention period is set to 30 days. This sample uses the encryption option by specifying the encryption algorithm and the encryptor information.  
  
    ```  
    Use msdb;  
    GO  
    EXEC smart_admin.sp_set_db_backup   
                    @database_name='TestDB'   
                    ,@enable_backup=1  
                    ,@retention_days =30   
                    ,@credential_name ='MyCredential'  
                    ,@encryption_algorithm ='AES_256'  
                    ,@encryptor_type= 'Certificate'  
                    ,@encryptor_name='MyBackupCert'  
    GO  
  
    ```  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The retention period can be set to any value from 1 to 30 days.  
    >   
    >  For more information on creating a certificate for encryption, see the Create a Backup Certificate step in [Create an Encrypted Backup](../relational-databases/backup-restore/create-an-encrypted-backup.md).  
  
     For more information on this stored procedure, see [smart_admin.set_db_backup &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn451013(v=sql.120).aspx)  
  
     To review the configuration settings for a database use the following query:  
  
    ```  
    Use msdb  
    GO  
    SELECT * FROM smart_admin.fn_backup_db_config('TestDB')  
    ```  
  
##  <a name="InstanceConfigure"></a> Enable and Configure Default [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] settings for the Instance  
 You can enable and configure default [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] settings at the instance level in two ways:  By using the system stored procedure `smart_backup.set_instance_backup` or **SQL Server Management Studio**. The two methods are explained below:  
  
 **smart_backup.set_instance_backup:**. By specifying the value **1** for *@enable_backup* parameter, you can enable backup and set the default configurations. Once applied at the instance level, these default settings are applied to any new database that is added to this instance.  When [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] is enabled for the first time, the following information must be provided in addition to enabling [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] on the instance:  
  
-   The retention period.  
  
-   SQL Credential used to authenticate to the Windows Azure storage account.  
  
-   The encryption option. Either specify not to encrypt using *@encryption_algorithm* = **NO_ENCRYPTION** or specify a supported encryption algorithm. For more information on encryption, see [Backup Encryption](../relational-databases/backup-restore/backup-encryption.md).  
  
 Once enabled these settings are persisted. If you are changing the configuration, only the database name and the setting you want to change is required. [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] retains the existing values when not specified.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Before configuring [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] on an instance, it might be useful to check for existing configuration, if any. The step to reviewing configuration settings for a database is explained later in this section.  
  
 **SQL Server Management Studio:** To do this task in SQL Server Management Studio, go the object explorer, expand the **Management** node, and right click on **Managed Backup**. Select **Configure**. This opens the **Managed Backup** dialog. Use this dialog to specify the retention period, SQL Credential, Storage URL, and the encryption settings. For specific help with this dialog, see [Configure Managed Backup &#40;SQL Server Management Studio&#41;](configure-managed-backup-sql-server-management-studio.md).  
  
#### Using Transact-SQL  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click `Execute`.  
  
```  
Use msdb;  
Go  
   EXEC smart_admin.sp_set_instance_backup  
                @retention_days=30   
                ,@credential_name='sqlbackuptoURL'  
                ,@encryption_algorithm ='AES_128'  
                ,@encryptor_type= 'Certificate'  
                ,@encryptor_name='MyBackupCert'  
                ,@enable_backup=1;  
GO  
  
```  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The retention period can be set to any value from 1 to 30 days.  
>   
>  For more information on creating a certificate for encryption, see the Create a Backup Certificate step in [Create an Encrypted Backup](../relational-databases/backup-restore/create-an-encrypted-backup.md).  
  
 To view the default configuration settings for the instance, use the following query:  
  
```  
Use msdb;  
GO  
SELECT * FROM smart_admin.fn_backup_instance_config ();  
  
```  
  
#### Using PowerShell  
  
1.  Start a PowerShell Instance  
  
2.  Run the following script after modifying it to suit your settings  
  
    ```  
    C:\ PS> cd SQLSERVER:\SQL\Computer\MyInstance   
    $encryptionOption = New-SqlBackupEncryptionOption -EncryptionAlgorithm Aes128 -EncryptorType ServerCertificate -EncryptorName "MyBackupCert"  
    Get-SqlSmartAdmin | Set-SqlSmartAdmin –BackupEnabled $True –BackupRetentionPeriodInDays 10 -EncryptionOption $encryptionOption  
    ```  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When you create a new database after configuring the default settings, it may take up to 15 minutes for the database to be configured with the default settings. This also applies to databases that are changed from **Simple** to **Full** or **Bulk-Logged** recovery model.  
  
##  <a name="DatabaseDisable"></a> Disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for a database  
 You can disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] settings by using the `sp_set_db_backup` system stored procedure. The *@enableparameter* is used to enable and disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] configurations for a specific database, where 1 enables and 0 disables the configuration settings.  
  
#### To Disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for a specific database:  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click `Execute`.  
  
```  
Use msdb;  
Go  
EXEC smart_admin.sp_set_db_backup   
                @database_name='TestDB'   
                ,@enable_backup=0;  
GO  
  
```  
  
##  <a name="DatabaseAllDisable"></a> Disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] for all the databases on the Instance  
 The following procedure is for when you want to disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] configuration settings from all the databases that currently have [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] enabled on the instance.  The configuration settings like the storage URL, retention, and the SQL Credential will remain in the metadata and can be used  if [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] is enabled for the database at a later time. If you want to just pause [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] services temporarily, you can use the master switch explained in the following sections later in this topic.  
  
#### To disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)]for all the databases:  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click `Execute`. The following example identifies if [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] is configured at the instance level and all the [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] enabled databases on the instance, and executes the system stored procedure `sp_set_db_backup` to disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)].  
  
```  
-- Create a working table to store the database names  
Declare @DBNames TABLE  
  
       (  
             RowID int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY  
             ,DBName varchar(500)  
  
       )  
-- Define the variables  
DECLARE @rowid int  
DECLARE @dbname varchar(500)  
DECLARE @SQL varchar(2000)  
-- Get the database names from the system function  
  
INSERT INTO @DBNames (DBName)  
  
SELECT db_name  
       FROM   
  
       smart_admin.fn_backup_db_config (NULL)  
       WHERE is_smart_backup_enabled = 1  
  
       --Select DBName from @DBNames  
  
       select @rowid = min(RowID)  
       FROM @DBNames  
  
       WHILE @rowID IS NOT NULL  
       Begin  
  
             Set @dbname = (Select DBName From @DBNames Where RowID = @rowid)  
             Begin  
             Set @SQL = 'EXEC smart_admin.sp_set_db_backup    
                @database_name= '''+'' + @dbname+ ''+''',   
                @enable_backup=0'  
  
            EXECUTE (@SQL)  
  
             END  
             Select @rowid = min(RowID)  
             From @DBNames Where RowID > @rowid  
  
       END  
  
```  
  
 To review the configuration settings for all the databases on the instance, use the following query:  
  
```  
Use msdb;  
GO  
SELECT * FROM smart_admin.fn_backup_db_config (NULL);  
GO  
  
```  
  
##  <a name="InstanceDisable"></a> Disable Default [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] settings for the Instance  
 Default settings at the instance level apply to all new databases created on that instance.  If you no longer need or require default settings, you can disable this configuration by using the **smart_admin.sp_set_instance_backup** System stored procedure. Disabling does not remove the other configuration settings like the storage URL, retention setting, or the SQL Credential name. These settings will be used if [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] is enabled for the instance at a later time.  
  
#### To disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] default configuration settings:  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click `Execute`.  
  
    ```  
    Use msdb;  
    Go  
    EXEC smart_admin.sp_set_instance_backup  
                    @enable_backup=0;  
    GO  
  
    ```  
  
#### Using PowerShell  
  
1.  Start a PowerShell Instance  
  
2.  Run the following script:  
  
    ```  
    C:\ PS> cd SQLSERVER:\SQL\Computer\MyInstance   
    Set-SqlSmartAdmin –BackupEnabled $False  
    ```  
  
##  <a name="InstancePause"></a> Pause [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] at the Instance Level  
 There might be times when you need to temporarily pause the [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] services for a short period time.  The `smart_admin.sp_backup_master_switch` system stored procedure allows you to disable [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] service at the instance level.  The same stored procedure is used to resume [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)]. The @state parameter is used to define whether [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] should be turned off or on.  
  
#### To Pause [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] Services Using Transact-SQL:  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and then click `Execute`  
  
```  
Use msdb;  
GO  
EXEC smart_admin.sp_backup_master_switch @new_state=0;  
Go  
  
```  
  
#### To pause [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] Using PowerShell
