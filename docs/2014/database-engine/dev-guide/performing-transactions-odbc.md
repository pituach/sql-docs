# Performing Transactions (ODBC)
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client ODBC driver support the ODBC API transaction management functions. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] offers full support for local transactions on an individual server. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client ODBC driver uses these features to support the ODBC API functions that manage transactions.  
  
 Through the use of the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC), the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client ODBC driver can participate in distributed transactions spanning multiple servers.
