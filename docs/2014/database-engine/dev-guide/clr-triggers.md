# CLR Triggers
  Because of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] integration with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] common language runtime (CLR), you can use any [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] language to create CLR triggers. This section covers information specific to triggers implemented with CLR integration. For a complete discussion of triggers, see [DDL Triggers](../../relational-databases/triggers/ddl-triggers.md).  
  
## What Are Triggers?  
 A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when a language event executes. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] includes two general types of triggers: data manipulation language (DML) and data definition language (DDL) triggers. DML triggers can be used when `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements modify data in a specified table or view. DDL triggers fire stored procedures in response to a variety of DDL statements, which are primarily statements that begin with `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`. DDL triggers can be used for administrative tasks, such as auditing and regulating database operations.  
  
## Unique Capabilities of CLR Triggers  
 Triggers written in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] have the capability of determining which columns from the firing view or table have been updated by using the `UPDATE(column)` and `COLUMNS_UPDATED()` functions.  
  
 Triggers written in a CLR language differ from other CLR integration objects in several significant ways. CLR triggers can:  
  
-   Reference data in the `INSERTED` and `DELETED` tables  
  
-   Determine which columns have been modified as a result of an `UPDATE` operation  
  
-   Access information about database objects affected by the execution of DDL statements.  
  
 These capabilities are provided inherently in the query language, or by the `SqlTriggerContext` class. For information about the advantages of CLR integration and choosing between managed code and [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)], see [Overview of CLR Integration](../../relational-databases/clr-integration/clr-integration-overview.md).  
  
## Using the SqlTriggerContext Class  
 The `SqlTriggerContext` class cannot be publicly constructed and can only be obtained by accessing the `SqlContext.TriggerContext` property within the body of a CLR trigger. The `SqlTriggerContext` class can be obtained from the active `SqlContext` by calling the `SqlContext.TriggerContext` property:  
  
 `SqlTriggerContext myTriggerContext = SqlContext.TriggerContext;`  
  
 The `SqlTriggerContext` class provides context information about the trigger. This contextual information includes the type of action that caused the trigger to fire, which columns were modified in an UPDATE operation, and, in the case of a DDL trigger, an XML `EventData` structure which describes the triggering operation. For more information, see [EVENTDATA &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/t-sql/functions/eventdata-transact-sql).  
  
### Determining the Trigger Action  
 Once you have obtained a `SqlTriggerContext`, you can use it to determine the type of action that caused the trigger to fire. This information is available through the `TriggerAction` property of the `SqlTriggerContext` class.  
  
 For DML triggers, the `TriggerAction` property can be one of the following values:  
  
-   TriggerAction.Update (0x1)  
  
-   TriggerAction.Insert (0x2)  
  
-   TriggerAction.Delete(0x3)  
  
-   For DDL triggers, the list of possible TriggerAction values is considerably longer. Please see "TriggerAction Enumeration" in the .NET Framework SDK for more information.  
  
### Using the Inserted and Deleted Tables  
 Two special tables are used in DML trigger statements: the **inserted** table and the **deleted** table. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] automatically creates and manages these tables. You can use these temporary tables to test the effects of certain data modifications and to set conditions for DML trigger actions; however, you cannot alter the data in the tables directly.  
  
 CLR triggers can access the **inserted** and **deleted** tables through the CLR in-process provider. This is done by obtaining a `SqlCommand` object from the SqlContext object. For example:  
  
 C#  
  
```  
SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection ("context connection = true");  
connection.Open();  
SqlCommand command = connection.CreateCommand();  
command.CommandText = "SELECT * from " + "inserted";  
```  
  
 Visual Basic  
  
```  
Dim connection As New SqlConnection("context connection=true")  
Dim command As SqlCommand  
connection.Open()  
command = connection.CreateCommand()  
command.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM " + "inserted"  
```  
  
### Determining Updated Columns  
 You can determine the number of columns that were modified by an UPDATE operation by using the `ColumnCount` property of the `SqlTriggerContext` object. You can use the `IsUpdatedColumn` method, which takes the column ordinal as an input parameter, to determine whether the column was updated. A `True` value indicates that the column has been updated.  
  
 For example, this code snippet (from the EmailAudit trigger later in this topic) lists all of the columns updated:  
  
 C#  
  
```  
reader = command.ExecuteReader();  
reader.Read();  
for (int columnNumber = 0; columnNumber < triggContext.ColumnCount; columnNumber++)  
{  
   pipe.Send("Updated column "  
      + reader.GetName(columnNumber) + "? "  
   + triggContext.IsUpdatedColumn(columnNumber).ToString());  
 }  
  
 reader.Close();  
```  
  
 Visual Basic  
  
```  
reader = command.ExecuteReader()  
reader.Read()  
Dim columnNumber As Integer  
  
For columnNumber=0 To triggContext.ColumnCount-1  
  
   pipe.Send("Updated column " & reader.GetName(columnNumber) & _  
   "? " & triggContext.IsUpdatedColumn(columnNumber).ToString() )  
  
Next  
  
reader.Close()  
```  
  
### Accessing EventData for CLR DDL Triggers  
 DDL triggers, like regular triggers, fire stored procedures in response to an event. But unlike DML triggers, they do not fire in response to UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE statements on a table or view. Instead, they fire in response to a variety of DDL statements, which are primarily statements that begin with CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. DDL triggers can be used for administrative tasks, such as auditing and monitoring of database operations and schema changes.  
  
 Information about an event that fires a DDL trigger is available in the `EventData` property of the `SqlTriggerContext` class. This property contains an `xml` value. The xml schema includes information about:  
  
-   The time of the event.  
  
-   The System Process ID (SPID) of the connection during which the trigger executed.  
  
-   The type of event that fired the trigger.  
  
 Then, depending on the event type, the schema includes additional information, such as the database in which the event occurred, the object against which the event occurred, and the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] command of the event.  
  
 In the following example, the following DDL trigger returns the raw `EventData` property.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Sending results and messages through the `SqlPipe` object is shown here for illustrative purposes only and is generally discouraged for production code when programming CLR triggers. Additional data returned may be unexpected and lead to application errors.

       {  
           case TriggerAction.DropTable:  
           SqlContext.Pipe.Send("Table dropped! Here's the EventData:");

    Public Shared Sub DropTableTrigger()  
        Dim triggContext As SqlTriggerContext  
        triggContext = SqlContext.TriggerContext  
  
        Select Case triggContext.TriggerAction  
           Case TriggerAction.DropTable  
              SqlContext.Pipe.Send("Table dropped! Here's the EventData:")  
              SqlContext.Pipe.Send(triggContext.EventData.Value)  
  
           Case Else  
              SqlContext.Pipe.Send("Something else happened! Here's the EventData:")  
              SqlContext.Pipe.Send(triggContext.EventData.Value)  
  
        End Select  
    End Sub  
End Class     
```  
  
 The following sample output is the `EventData` property value after a DDL trigger fired by a `CREATE TABLE` event:  
  
 `<EVENT_INSTANCE><PostTime>2004-04-16T21:17:16.160</PostTime><SPID>58</SPID><EventType>CREATE_TABLE</EventType><ServerName>MACHINENAME</ServerName><LoginName>MYDOMAIN\myname</LoginName><UserName>MYDOMAIN\myname</UserName><DatabaseName>AdventureWorks</DatabaseName><SchemaName>dbo</SchemaName><ObjectName>UserName</ObjectName><ObjectType>TABLE</ObjectType><TSQLCommand><SetOptions ANSI_NULLS="ON" ANSI_NULL_DEFAULT="ON" ANSI_PADDING="ON" QUOTED_IDENTIFIER="ON" ENCRYPTED="FALSE" /><CommandText>create table dbo.UserName  
(  
 UserName varchar(50),  
 RealName varchar(50)  
)  
</CommandText></TSQLCommand></EVENT_INSTANCE>`  
  
 In addition to the information accessible through the `SqlTriggerContext` class, queries can still refer to `COLUMNS_UPDATED` and inserted/deleted within the text of a command executed in-process.  
  
## Sample CLR Trigger  
 In this example, consider the scenario in which you let the user choose any ID they want, but you want to know the users that specifically entered an e-mail address as an ID. The following trigger would detect that information and log it to an audit table.

```  
CREATE TABLE Users

 The [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement that creates the trigger in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is as follows, and assumes assembly **SQLCLRTest** is already registered in the current [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database.  
  
```  
CREATE TRIGGER EmailAudit  
ON Users  
FOR INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE  
AS  
EXTERNAL NAME SQLCLRTest.CLRTriggers.EmailAudit  
```  
  
## Validating and Canceling Invalid Transactions  
 Using triggers to validate and cancel invalid INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE transactions or to prevent changes to your database schema is common. This can be accomplished by incorporating validation logic into your trigger and then rolling back the current transaction if the action does not meet the validation criteria.  
  
 When called within a trigger, the `Transaction.Rollback` method or a SqlCommand with the command text "TRANSACTION ROLLBACK" throws an exception with an ambiguous error message and must be wrapped in a try/catch block. The error message you see is similar to the following:

Msg 6549, Level 16, State 1, Procedure trig_InsertValidator, Line 0  
A .NET Framework error occurred during execution of user defined routine or aggregate 'trig_InsertValidator':   
System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Transaction is not allowed to roll back inside a user defined routine, trigger or aggregate because the transaction is not started in that CLR level. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting… User transaction, if any, will be rolled back.  
```  
  
 This exception is expected and the try/catch block is necessary for code execution to continue. When the trigger code finishes execution, another exception is raised  
  
```  
Msg 3991, Level 16, State 1, Procedure trig_InsertValidator, Line 1   
The context transaction which was active before entering user defined routine, trigger or aggregate "trig_InsertValidator" has been ended inside of it, which is not allowed. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting.  
The statement has been terminated.  
```  
  
 This exception is also expected, and a try/catch block around the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement that performs the action that fires the trigger is necessary so that execution can continue. Despite the two exceptions thrown, the transaction is rolled back and the changes are not committed to the table. A major difference between CLR triggers and [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] triggers is that [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] triggers can continue to perform more work after the transaction is rolled back.  
  
### Example  
 The following trigger performs simple validation of INSERT statements on a table. If the inserted integer value is equal to one, the transaction is rolled back and the value is not inserted into the table. All other integer values are inserted into the table. Note the try/catch block around the `Transaction.Rollback` method. The [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] script creates a test table, assembly, and managed stored procedure. Note that the two INSERT statements are wrapped in a try/catch block so that the exception thrown when the trigger finishes execution is caught.
