# Password Expired
  Appears when you connect to a server with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication, and the password you provided is correct but has expired. Also appears when you connect to a server with a new account that is created by using the **User must change password at next logon** option.
