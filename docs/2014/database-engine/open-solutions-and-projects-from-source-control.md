# Open Solutions and Projects from Source Control
  You can use [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to open a solution or project directly from source control. When you open a solution from source control, the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] environment automatically retrieves the latest version of the solution and copies it to the location you specify.  
  
 If you do not have a local copy of a solution, you must open it from source control before you can perform source control operations on it. After you have retrieved a local copy of the solution, you do not need to open it from source control again; you can open the local copy and use standard source control commands, such as **Get Latest Version** or **Check Out**, to perform the desired operation.  
  
 The following table describes the topics in this section.
