# View File History
  You can use the **History** command to view a version history for source-controlled files. This history includes the date and time when the file was added or checked in to source control.  
  
### To view the history of a file  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select the file.  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **Source Control** and click **History**.  
  
3.  In the **History of File** dialog box, perform any of the following actions:  
  
4.  View the selected version.  
  
5.  View specific details about the selected version.  
  
6.  Retrieve a copy of the selected version to your local disk.  
  
7.  View the differences between the selected version and the locally stored version.  
  
8.  Identify a specific version of a file as the current version.  
  
9. Export the history report to a printer, a file, or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows clipboard.  
  
 For information on how to perform these tasks, click the **Help** button in the **History of File** dialog box.
