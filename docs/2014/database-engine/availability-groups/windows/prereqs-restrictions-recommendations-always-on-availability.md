# Prerequisites, Restrictions, and Recommendations for AlwaysOn Availability Groups (SQL Server)
  This topic describes considerations for deploying [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)], including prerequisites, restrictions, and recommendations for host computers, Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) clusters, server instances, and availability groups. For each of these components security considerations and required permissions, if any, are indicated.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Before you deploy [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)], we strongly recommend that you read every section of this topic.  
  
 
  
##  <a name="DotNetHotfixes"></a> .Net Hotfixes that Support AlwaysOn Availability Groups  
 Depending on the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] components and features you will use with [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)], you may need to install additional .Net hotfixes identified in the following table. The hotfixes can be installed in any order.

###  <a name="ComputerRecommendations"></a> Recommendations for Computers That Host Availability Replicas (Windows System)  
  
-   **Comparable systems:**  For a given availability group, all the availability replicas should run on comparable systems that can handle identical workloads.  
  
-   **Dedicated network adapters:**  For best performance, use a dedicated network adapter (network interface card) for [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)].  
  
-   **Sufficient disk space:**  Every computer on which a server instance hosts an availability replica must possess sufficient disk space for all the databases in the availability group. Keep in mind that as primary databases grow, their corresponding secondary databases grow the same amount.  
  
###  <a name="PermissionsWindows"></a> Permissions (Windows System)  
 To administer a WSFC cluster, the user must be a system administrator on every cluster node.  
  
 For more information about the account for administering the cluster, see [Appendix A: Failover Cluster Requirements](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd197454\(WS.10\).aspx).

|Set the HostRecordTTL value.|[Change the HostRecordTTL (Using Windows PowerShell)](#ChangeHostRecordTTLps)|  
  
####  <a name="ChangeHostRecordTTLps"></a> Change the HostRecordTTL (Using Windows PowerShell)  
  
1.  Open PowerShell window via **Run as Administrator**.  
  
2.  Import the FailoverClusters module.  
  
3.  Use the `Get-ClusterResource` cmdlet to find the Network Name resource, then use `Set-ClusterParameter` cmdlet to set the `HostRecordTTL` value, as follows:  
  
     Get-ClusterResource “*\<NetworkResourceName>*” | Set-ClusterParameter HostRecordTTL *\<TimeInSeconds>*  
  
     The following PowerShell example sets the HostRecordTTL to 300 seconds for a Network Name resource named "`SQL Network Name (SQL35)`".  
  
    ```  
    Import-Module FailoverClusters  
  
    $nameResource = "SQL Network Name (SQL35)"  
    Get-ClusterResource $nameResource | Set-ClusterParameter ClusterParameter HostRecordTTL 300  
    ```  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  Every time you open a new PowerShell window, you need to import the `FailoverClusters` module.

##  <a name="ServerInstance"></a> SQL Server Instance Prerequisites and Restrictions  
 Each availability group requires a set of failover partners, known as *availability replicas*, which are hosted by instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. A given server instance can be a *stand-alone instance* or a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]*failover cluster instance* (FCI).

###  <a name="ThreadUsage"></a> Thread Usage by Availability Groups  
 [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] has the following requirements for worker threads:  
  
-   On an idle instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] uses 0 threads.  
  
-   The maximum number of threads used by availability groups is the configured setting for the maximum number of server threads ('`max worker threads`') minus 40.  
  
-   The availability replicas hosted on a given server instance share a single thread pool.  
  
     Threads are shared on an on-demand basis, as follows:  
  
    -   Typically, there are 3–10 shared threads, but this number can increase depending on the primary replica workload.  
  
    -   If a given thread is idle for a while, it is released back into the general [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] thread pool. Normally, an inactive thread is released after ~15 seconds of inactivity. However, depending on the last activity, an idle thread might be retained longer.  
  
-   In addition, availability groups use unshared threads, as follows:  
  
    -   Each primary replica uses 1 Log Capture thread for each primary database. In addition, it uses 1 Log Send thread for each secondary database. Log send threads are released after ~15 seconds of inactivity.  
  
    -   Each secondary replica uses 1 redo thread for each secondary database. Redo threads are released after ~15 seconds of inactivity.  
  
    -   A backup on a secondary replica holds a thread on the primary replica for the duration of the backup operation.

##  <a name="NetworkConnect"></a> Network Connectivity Recommendations  
 We strongly recommend that you use the same network links for communications between WSFC cluster members and communications between availability replicas.  Using separate network links can cause unexpected behaviors if some of links fail (even intermittently).  
  
 For example, for an availability group to support automatic failover, the secondary replica that is the automatic-failover partner must be in the SYNCHRONIZED state. If the network link to this secondary replica fails (even intermittently), the replica enters the UNSYNCHRONIZED state and cannot begin to resynchronize until the link is restored. If the WSFC cluster requests an automatic failover while the secondary replica is unsynchronized, automatic failover will not occur.  
  
##  <a name="ClientConnSupport"></a> Client Connectivity Support

> [!NOTE]  
>  Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], AlwaysOn Failover Cluster Instances supports Clustered Shared Volumes (CSV) in both [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../../includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../../includes/win8srv-md.md)]. For more information on CSV, see [Understanding Cluster Shared Volumes in a Failover Cluster](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd759255.aspx).  
  
-   **The cluster nodes of an FCI can host only one replica for a given availability group:**  If you add an availability replica on an FCI, the WSFC cluster nodes that are possible FCI owners cannot host another replica for the same availability group.  
  
     Furthermore, every other replica must be hosted by an instance of SQL Server 2012 that resides on a different WSFC node in the same WSFC cluster. The only exception is that while being migrated to another WSFC cluster, an availability group can temporarily straddle two clusters.  
  
-   **FCIs do not support automatic failover by availability groups:**  FCIs do not support automatic failover by availability groups, so any availability replica that is hosted by an FCI can be configured for manual failover only.  
  
-   **Changing FCI network name:**  If you need to change the network name of an FCI that hosts an availability replica, you will need to remove the replica from its availability group and then add the replica back into the availability group. You cannot remove the primary replica, so if you are renaming an FCI that is hosting the primary replica, you should fail over to a secondary replica and then remove the former primary replica and add it back. Note that renaming an FCI might alter the URL of its database mirroring endpoint. When you add the replica ensure that you specify the current endpoint URL.

##  <a name="PrerequisitesForAGs"></a> Availability Group Prerequisites and Restrictions  

  
###  <a name="RestrictionsAG"></a> Restrictions (Availability Groups)  
  
-   **Availability replicas must be hosted by different nodes of one WSFC cluster:**  For a given availability group, availability replicas must be hosted by server instances running on different nodes of the same WSFC cluster. The only exception is that while being migrated to another WSFC cluster, an availability group can temporarily straddle two clusters.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Virtual machines on the same physical computer can each host an availability replica for the same availability group because each virtual machine acts as a separate computer.  
  
-   **Unique availability group name:**  Each availability group name must be unique on the WSFC cluster. The maximum length for an availability group name is 128 characters.  
  
-   **Availability replicas:**  Each availability group supports one primary replica and up to eight secondary replicas. All of the replicas can run under asynchronous-commit mode, or up to three of them can run under synchronous-commit mode (one primary replica with two synchronous secondary replicas).  
  
-   **Maximum number of availability groups and availability databases per computer:** The actual number of databases and availability groups you can put on a computer (VM or physical) depends on the hardware and workload, but there is no enforced limit. Microsoft has extensively tested with 10 AGs and 100 DBs per physical machine. Signs of overloaded systems can include, but are not limited to, worker thread exhaustion, slow response times for AlwaysOn system views and DMVs, and/or stalled dispatcher system dumps. Please make sure to thoroughly test your environment with a production-like workload to ensure it can handle peak workload capacity within your application SLAs. When considering SLAs be sure to consider load under failure conditions as well as expected response times.  
  
-   **Do not use the Failover Cluster Manager to manipulate availability groups:**  
  
     For example:  
  
    -   Do not change any availability group properties, such as the possible owners.  
  
    -   Do not use the Failover Cluster Manager to fail over availability groups. You must use [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
###  <a name="RequirementsAG"></a> Prerequisites (Availability Groups)  
 When creating or reconfiguring an availability group configuration, ensure that you adhere to the following requirements.  
  
||Prerequisite|Description|  
|-|------------------|-----------------|  
|![Checkbox](../../media/checkboxemptycenterxtraspacetopandright.gif "Checkbox")|If you plan to use a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance (FCI) to host an availability replica, ensure that you understand the FCI restrictions and that the FCI requirements are met.|[Prerequisites and Restrictions for Using a SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) to Host an Availability Replica](#FciArLimitations) (earlier in this topic)|  
  
###  <a name="SecurityAG"></a> Security (Availability Groups)  
  
-   Security is inherited from the Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster. WSFC provides two levels of user security at granularity of entire WSFC cluster APIs:  
  
    -   Read-only access  
  
    -   Full control  
  
         [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] needs full control, and enabling [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] gives it full control of the WSFC cluster (through Service SID).  
  
         You cannot directly add or remove security for a server instance in the WSFC Failover Cluster Manager. To manage WSFC security sessions, use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager or the WMI equivalent from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   Each instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] must have permissions to access the registry, cluster, and soforth.  
  
-   We recommend that you use encryption for connections between server instances that host [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] availability replicas.  
  
#### Permissions (Availability Groups)  
  
|Task|Required Permissions|

###  <a name="RestrictionsDb"></a> Restrictions (Availability Databases)  
  
-   If the file path (including the drive letter) of a secondary database differs from the path of the corresponding primary database, the following restrictions apply:  
  
    -   **[!INCLUDE[ssAoNewAgWiz](../../../includes/ssaonewagwiz-md.md)]/[!INCLUDE[ssAoAddDbWiz](../../../includes/ssaoadddbwiz-md.md)]:**  The **Full** option is not supported (on the[Select Initial Data Synchronization Page](select-initial-data-synchronization-page-always-on-availability-group-wizards.md) page),  
  
    -   **RESTORE WITH MOVE:**  To create the secondary databases, the database files must be RESTORED WITH MOVE on each instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that hosts a secondary replica.  
  
    -   **Impact on add-file operations:**  A later add-file operation on the primary replica might fail on the secondary databases. This failure could cause the secondary databases to be suspended. This, in turn, causes the secondary replicas to enter the NOT SYNCHRONIZING state.  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  For information about responding to a failed ad-file operation, see [Troubleshoot a Failed Add-File Operation &#40;AlwaysOn Availability Groups&#41;](troubleshoot-a-failed-add-file-operation-always-on-availability-groups.md).  
  
-   You cannot drop a database that currently belongs to an availability group.  
  
###  <a name="TDEdbs"></a> Follow Up for TDE Protected Databases  
 If you use transparent data encryption (TDE), the certificate or asymmetric key for creating and decrypting other keys must be the same on every server instance that hosts an availability replica for the availability group. For more information, see [Move a TDE Protected Database to Another SQL Server](../../../relational-databases/security/encryption/move-a-tde-protected-database-to-another-sql-server.md).  
  
###  <a name="PermissionsDbs"></a> Permissions (Availability Databases)
