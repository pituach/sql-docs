# Always On Policies for Operational Issues with Always On Availability Groups (SQL Server)
  The [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] health model evaluates a set of predefined policy based management (PBM) policies. You can use theses for viewing the health of an availability group and its availability replicas and databases in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
 
  
##  <a name="TermsAndDefinitions"></a> Terms and Definitions  
 AlwaysOn predefined policies  
 A set of built-in policies that allow a database administrator to check an availability group and its availability replicas and databases for compliance with the states that are defined by the AlwaysOn policies.  
  
 [AlwaysOn Availability Groups](always-on-availability-groups-sql-server.md) 
 A high-availability and disaster-recovery solution that provides an enterprise-level alternative to database mirroring.  
  
 availability group  
 A container for a discrete set of user databases, known as *availability databases*, that fail over together.  
  
 availability replica  
 An instantiation of an availability group that is hosted by a specific instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and that maintains a local copy of each availability database that belongs to the availability group. Two types of availability replicas exist: a single *primary replica* and one to four *secondary replicas*. The server instances that host the availability replicas for a given availability group must reside on different nodes of a single Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster.  
  
 availability database  
 A database that belongs to an availability group. For each availability database, the availability group maintains a single read-write copy (the *primary database*) and one to four read-only copies (*secondary databases*).  
  
 AlwaysOn Dashboard  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] dashboard that provides an at-a-glance view of the health of an availability group. For more information, see [AlwaysOn Dashboard](#Dashboard), later in this topic.  
  
##  <a name="AlwaysOnPBM"></a> Predefined Policies and Issues  
 The following table summarizes the predefined policies.  
  
|Policy name|Issue|Category**<sup>*</sup>**|Facet|  
|-----------------|-----------|------------------------------|-----------|  
|WSFC Cluster State|[WSFC cluster service is offline](wsfc-cluster-service-is-offline.md).|Critical|Instance of SQL Server|  
|Availability Group Online State|[Availability group is offline](availability-group-is-offline.md).|Critical|Availability group|  
|Availability Group Automatic Failover Readiness|[Availability group is not ready for automatic failover](availability-group-is-not-ready-for-automatic-failover.md).|Critical|Availability group|  
|Availability Replicas Data Synchronization State|[Some availability replicas are not synchronizing data](some-availability-replicas-are-not-synchronizing-data.md).|Warning|Availability group|  
|Synchronous Replicas Data Synchronization State|[Some synchronous replicas are not synchronized](some-synchronous-replicas-are-not-synchronized.md).|Warning|Availability group|  
|Availability Replicas Role State|[Some availability replicas do not have a healthy role](some-availability-replicas-do-not-have-a-healthy-role.md).|Warning|Availability group|  
|Availability Replicas Connection State|[Some availability replicas are disconnected](some-availability-replicas-are-disconnected.md).|Warning|Availability group|  
|Availability Replica Role State|[Availability replica does not have a healthy role](availability-replica-does-not-have-a-healthy-role.md).|Critical|Availability replica|  
|Availability Replica Connection State|[Availability replica is disconnected](availability-replica-is-disconnected.md).|Critical|Availability replica|  
|Availability Replica Join State|[Availability replica is not joined](availability-replica-is-not-joined.md).|Warning|Availability replica|  
|Availability Replica Data Synchronization State|[Data synchronization state of some availability database is not healthy](data-synchronization-state-of-some-availability-database-is-not-healthy.md).|Warning|Availability replica|  
|Availability Database Suspension State|[Availability database is suspended](availability-database-is-suspended.md).|Warning|Availability database|  
|Availability Database Join State|[Secondary database is not joined](secondary-database-is-not-joined.md).|Warning|Availability database|  
|Availability Database Data Synchronization State|[Data synchronization state of availability database is not healthy](data-synchronization-state-of-availability-database-is-not-healthy.md).|Warning|Availability database|  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  **<sup>*</sup>**  For AlwaysOn policies, the category names are used as IDs. Changing the name of an AlwaysOn category would break its health-evaluation functionality. Therefore, do not modify the names of AlwaysOn categories.  
  
##  <a name="Dashboard"></a> AlwaysOn Dashboard  
 The AlwaysOn Dashboard gives you an at-a-glance view of the health of an availability group. The AlwaysOn Dashboard includes the following features:  
  
-   Enables you to easily display details about a given availability group, its availability replicas, and its databases.  
  
-   Displays visual indications of key states to help database administrators make quick operational decisions.  
  
-   Provides launch points for troubleshooting scenarios.  
  
-   For a given operational issue, populates the **Policy Evaluation Result** dialog box with information about specific AlwaysOn health policy violations and with links to remediation help.  
  
-   Provides an health extended event viewer to show previous events for AlwaysOn-specific issues.  
  
-   If failing over the availability group is a possible remediation for an issue, provides a launch point for the links[Fail Over Availability Group Wizard](use-the-fail-over-availability-group-wizard-sql-server-management-studio.md). This wizard takes a database administrator through the manual failover process.  
  
##  <a name="ExtendHealthModel"></a> Extending the AlwaysOn Health Model  
 Extending the [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] health model is simply a matter of creating your own user-defined policies and putting them into certain categories based on the type of object that you are monitoring.  After you a alter few settings, the AlwaysOn dashboard will automatically evaluate your own user-defined policies, as well as the AlwaysOn predefined policies.  
  
 A user-defined policy can use any of the available PBM facets, including those used by the AlwaysOn predefined policies (see [Predefined Policies and Issues](#AlwaysOnPBM), earlier in this topic). The Server facet provides the following properties for monitoring [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] health: (`IsHadrEnabled` and `HadrManagerStatus`). The Server facet also provides properties the following policies for monitoring the WSFC cluster configuration: `ClusterQuorumType`, and `ClusterQuorumState`.
