# Availability database is suspended
    
## Introduction  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|**Policy Name**|Availability Database Suspension State|  
|**Issue**|Availability database is suspended.|  
|**Category**|**Warning**|  
|**Facet**|Availability database|  
  
## Description  
 This policy checks the state of data movement of the secondary database (also known as a "secondary database replica"). The policy is in an unhealthy state when the data movement is suspended. The policy is otherwise in a healthy state.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For this release of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)], information about possible causes and solutions is located at [Availability database is suspended](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=220860) on the TechNet Wiki.  
  
## Possible Causes  
 Data synchronization on this availability database might have been suspended because of the following:  
  
-   Due to an error, the system might have suspended data synchronization.  
  
-   The database administrator might have suspended data synchronization for maintenance purposes.  
  
## Possible Solution  
 Resume data synchronization. If the issue persists, check the availability group in the Event log, and then diagnose why the system suspended data movement.
