# Monitoring of Availability Groups (SQL Server)
  To monitor the properties and state of an AlwaysOn availability group you can use the following tools.  
  
|Tool|Brief Description|Links|  
|----------|-----------------------|-----------|  
|System Center Monitoring pack for SQL Server|The Monitoring pack for SQL Server (SQLMP) is the recommended solution for monitoring availability groups, availability replica and availability databases for IT administrators. Monitoring features that are particularly relevance to [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] include the following:<br /><br /> Automatic discoverability of availability groups, availability replicas, and availability database from among hundreds of computers. This enables you to easily keep track of your [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] inventory.<br /><br /> Fully capable System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) alerting and ticketing. These features provide detailed knowledge that enables faster resolution to a problem.<br /><br /> A custom extension to AlwaysOn Health monitoring using Policy Based management (PBM).<br /><br /> Health roll ups from availability databases to availability replicas.<br /><br /> Custom tasks that manage [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] from the System Center Operations Manager console.|To download the monitoring pack (SQLServerMP.msi) and *SQL Server Management Pack Guide for System Center Operations Manager* (SQLServerMPGuide.doc), see:<br /><br /> [System Center Monitoring pack for SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=10631)|  
|[!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] catalog and dynamic management views provide a wealth of information about your availability groups and their replicas, databases, listeners, and WSFC cluster environment.|[Monitor Availability Groups &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](monitor-availability-groups-transact-sql.md)|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]|The **Object Explorer Details** pane displays basic information about the availability groups hosted on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to which you are connected.<br /><br /> Tip: Use this pane to select multiple availability groups, replicas, or databases and to perform routine administrative tasks on the selected objects; for example, removing multiple availability replicas or databases from an availability group.|[Use the Object Explorer Details to Monitor Availability Groups &#40;SQL Server Management Studio&#41;](use-object-explorer-details-to-monitor-availability-groups.md)|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]|**Properties** dialog boxes enable you to view the properties of availability groups, replicas, or listeners and, in some cases, to change their values.|[View Availability Group Properties &#40;SQL Server&#41;](view-availability-group-properties-sql-server.md)<br /><br /> [View Availability Replica Properties &#40;SQL Server&#41;](view-availability-replica-properties-sql-server.md)<br /><br /> [View Availability Group Listener Properties &#40;SQL Server&#41;](view-availability-group-listener-properties-sql-server.md)|  
|System Monitor|The **SQLServer:Availability Replica** performance object contains performance counters that report information about availability replicas.|[SQL Server, Availability Replica](../../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-availability-replica.md)|  
|System Monitor|The **SQLServer:Database Replica** performance object contains performance counters that report information about the secondary databases on a given secondary replica.<br /><br /> The **SQLServer:Databases** object in SQL Server contains performance counters that monitor transaction log activities, among other things. The following counters are particularly relevant for monitoring transaction-log activity on availability databases: **Log Flush Write Time (ms)**, **Log Flushes/sec**, **Log Pool Cache Misses/sec**, **Log Pool Disk Reads/sec**, and **Log Pool Requests/sec**.|[SQL Server, Database Replica](../../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-database-replica.md) and [SQL Server, Databases Object](../../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-databases-object.md)|
