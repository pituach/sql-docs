# Prerequisites for Migrating from Log Shipping to AlwaysOn Availability Groups (SQL Server)
  This topic describes the prerequisites for converting a log shipping primary database along with one or more of its secondary databases to an AlwaysOn primary database and secondary database(s).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can configure any primary or secondary database (possibly readable) in an availability group as a log shipping primary database.

##  <a name="AGPrereqsRealAddress"></a> Availability Group Prerequisites  
 To allow backup jobs to run on the primary replica of the availability group, use the following AlwaysOn Availability Groups backup settings:  
  
|Property|Setting|  
|--------------|-------------|  
|Automated backup preference of availability group|Only on the primary replica|  
|Backup priority of the primary replica.|>0|

##  <a name="LogShipPrereqs"></a> Log Shipping Prerequisites  
  
-   The log shipping primary database must reside on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that hosts the initial/current primary replica of the availability group.  
  
-   For a given log shipping secondary database to be converted to an AlwaysOn secondary database, it must:  
  
    -   Use the same name as the primary database.  
  
    -   Reside on a server instance that hosts a secondary replica for the availability group.  
  
 Once the backup job has run on the primary database, disable the backup job, and once the restore job has run on a given secondary database, disable the restore job.  
  
 After you have created all the secondary databases for the availability group, if you want to perform backups on secondary replicas, you need to re-configure the automated backup preference of the availability group.
