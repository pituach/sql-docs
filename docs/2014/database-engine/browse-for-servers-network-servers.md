# Browse for Servers (Network Servers)
  If you are connecting to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] component and you do not know the exact name of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance, click **Browse for more** in the **Server name** box to open the **Browse for Servers** dialog box.  
  
 This dialog is populated by the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service on the server computers. There are several reasons why the name of an instance might not appear in the list:  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service might not be running on the computer running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   UDP port 1434 might be blocked by a firewall.  
  
-   The **HideInstance** flag might be set.  
  
 To connect to an instance that does not appear in the list, type a full connection string for the instance, including the TCP/IP port number or the named pipes pipe name.  
  
## Options  
 **Select a SQL Server instance in the network for your connection**  
 Designate the server you want to connect to by clicking on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance displayed in the tree. You can show or hide portions of the tree view by clicking on the nodes marked with a **+** or **â€“** symbol.
