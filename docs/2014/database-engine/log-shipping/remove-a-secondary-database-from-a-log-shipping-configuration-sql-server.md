# Remove a Secondary Database from a Log Shipping Configuration (SQL Server)
  This topic describes how to remove a log shipping secondary database in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 The log-shipping stored procedures require membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To remove a log shipping secondary database  
  
1.  Connect to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that is currently the log shipping primary server and expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **Databases**, right-click the log shipping primary database, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  Under **Select a page**, click **Transaction Log Shipping**.  
  
4.  Under **Secondary server instances and databases**, click the database you want to remove.  
  
5.  Click **Remove**.  
  
6.  Click **OK** to update the configuration.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To Remove a Secondary Database  
  
1.  On the primary server, execute [sp_delete_log_shipping_primary_secondary](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-delete-log-shipping-primary-secondary-transact-sql) to delete the information about the secondary database from the primary server.  
  
2.  On the secondary server, execute [sp_delete_log_shipping_secondary_database](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-delete-log-shipping-secondary-database-transact-sql) to delete the secondary database.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If there are no other secondary databases with the same secondary ID, **sp_delete_log_shipping_secondary_primary** is invoked from **sp_delete_log_shipping_secondary_database** and deletes the entry for the secondary ID and the copy and restore jobs.  
  
3.  On the secondary server, disable the copy and restore jobs. For more information, see [Disable or Enable a Job](../../ssms/agent/disable-or-enable-a-job.md).
