# Compare Files
  You can compare files to determine how a file has progressed to its present state. For example, if you detect a defect in a build of your code project after a particular source file version is checked in, you can compare the current file version to a previous one. This helps you to pinpoint the code that introduced the defect.  
  
 You can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to compare a local copy of a project or file to the version stored in source control, or to compare two local files. Also, using the **History** command, you can compare any two source-controlled versions.  
  
### To compare files  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select either a project or one of the project files.  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **Source Control**, and click **Compare**.  
  
3.  In the **Difference Options** dialog box, select the appropriate options, and then click **Report**.
