# Set a SQL Server Alias for the SQL Server Agent Service (SQL Server Management Studio)
  This topic describes how to set a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] alias for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent to use to connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service connects to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] over named pipes by using dynamic server names that require no additional client configuration. You need to configure a server connection alias only if you are not using the default network transport or if you are connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that listens on an alternate named pipe.

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent will not work correctly unless you select an alias that refers to the local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   Object Explorer only displays the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent node if you have permission to use it.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 To perform its functions, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent must be configured to use the credentials of an account that is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The account must have the following Windows permissions:  
  
-   Log on as a service (SeServiceLogonRight)  
  
-   Replace a process-level token (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege)  
  
-   Bypass traverse checking (SeChangeNotifyPrivilege)  
  
-   Adjust memory quotas for a process (SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege)  
  
 For more information about the Windows permissions required for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service account, see [Select an Account for the SQL Server Agent Service](../ssms/agent/select-an-account-for-the-sql-server-agent-service.md) and [Configure Windows Service Accounts and Permissions](configure-windows/configure-windows-service-accounts-and-permissions.md).  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To set a SQL Server Alias for the SQL Server Agent Service  
  
1.  In the **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Right-click **SQL Server Agent**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **SQL Server Agent Properties***server_name* dialog box, under **Select a page**, select **Connection**, and  
  
4.  In the **Alias local host server** box, type the alias of the server to which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent should connect.  
  
5.  Click **OK**.
