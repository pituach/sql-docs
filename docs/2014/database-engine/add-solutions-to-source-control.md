# Add Solutions to Source Control
  When you add a solution to source control, you usually want to add the entire solution and all the projects it contains. You can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to add a solution to source control.  
  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] project resides completely on your local disk. You edit, save, and build projects locally. After adding the project to source control, you can use the **Check Out** command to check the project's files out of source control.  
  
### To add a solution to source control  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select the solution you want to add.  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **Source Control**, and then click **Add Solution to Source Control**.  
  
3.  If prompted, log on to your source control provider.  
  
4.  The **Add to SourceSafe Project** dialog box appears. The name of your project appears in the **Project** box.  
  
5.  In the **Folders** list, open the folder where you want to place your project. Alternatively, you can click **Create** to create a folder with the name displayed in the **Project** box.
