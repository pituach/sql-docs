# Remove Database Mirroring (SQL Server)
  This topic describes how to remove database mirroring from a database in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].  At any time, the database owner can manually stop a database mirroring session by removing mirroring from the database.

 Requires ALTER permission on the database.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To remove database mirroring  
  
1.  During a database mirroring session, connect to the principal server instance, in Object Explorer, click the server name to expand the server tree.  
  
2.  Expand **Databases**, and select the database.  
  
3.  Right-click the database, select **Tasks**, and then click **Mirror**. This opens the **Mirroring** page of the **Database Properties** dialog box.  
  
4.  In the **Select a Page** pane, click **Mirroring**.  
  
5.  To remove mirroring, click **Remove Mirroring**. A prompt asks for confirmation. If you click **Yes**, the session is stopped and mirroring is removed from the database.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
 To remove database mirroring, use the **Database Properties**. use the **Mirroring** page of the **Database Properties** dialog box.  
  
#### To remove database mirroring  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] of either mirroring partner.  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Issue the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement:  
  
    ```  
    ALTER DATABASE database_name SET PARTNER OFF  
    ```  
  
     where *database_name* is the mirrored database whose session you want to remove.  
  
     The following example removes database mirroring from the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample database.  
  
    ```  
    ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2012 SET PARTNER OFF;  
    ```

-   **If you intend to restart mirroring on the database**  
  
     Any log backups taken on the principal database after mirroring was removed must all be applied to the mirror database before you can restart mirroring.  
  
-   **If you do not intent to restart mirroring**  
  
     Optionally, you can recover the former mirror database. On the server instance that was the mirror server, you can use the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement:  
  
    ```  
    RESTORE DATABASE database_name WITH RECOVERY;  
    ```  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you recover this database, two divergent databases with the same name are online. Therefore, you need to ensure that clients can access only one of themâ€”typically the most recent principal database.
