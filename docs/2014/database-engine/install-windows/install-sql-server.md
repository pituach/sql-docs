# Install SQL Server 2014
## [ Download SQL Server 2014 Express ](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DownloadSQLServerExpress.aspx)
  **Thank you to [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) for collecting all of the installer package links in one place!**
  
 This topic provides an overview of different installation options we have for installing [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. For more information about the various [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components that can be installed, and the installation process, see [Installation for SQL Server 2014](installation-for-sql-server.md).  
> **NOTE:** [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is available in 32-bit and 64-bit editions. The 64-bit and 32-bit editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are installed either through the Installation Wizard, or at a command prompt.
