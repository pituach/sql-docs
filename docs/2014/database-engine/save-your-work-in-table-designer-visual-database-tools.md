# Save Your Work in Table Designer (Visual Database Tools)
  You can save changes to tables that are open in Table Designer.  
  
### To save a table  
  
1.  Click anywhere in the Table Designer.  
  
2.  From the **File** menu, choose **Save***tablename*.  
  
3.  In the **Save** dialog box, click **Yes** to update the database.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If the changes you are saving cause no changes to other tables, you won't see this dialog.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The list of tables in the **Save** dialog box may include tables other than the one you modified. For example, if you change the data type of a column that participates in a relationship with another table, both tables will be included in this list.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To save changes to all open items, such as tables, views, stored procedures, from the **File** menu choose **Save All**.
