# Data Quality Services
  [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversionLong](../includes/ssdqsnoversionlong-md.md)] (DQS) is a knowledge-driven data quality product. DQS enables you to build a knowledge base and use it to perform a variety of critical data quality tasks, including correction, enrichment, standardization, and de-duplication of your data. DQS enables you to perform data cleansing by using cloud-based reference data services provided by reference data providers. DQS also provides you with profiling that is integrated into its data-quality tasks, enabling you to analyze the integrity of your data.  
  
 DQS consists of [!INCLUDE[ssDQSServer](../includes/ssdqsserver-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../includes/ssdqsclient-md.md)], both of which are installed as part of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssDQSServer](../includes/ssdqsserver-md.md)] is a SQL Server instance feature that consists of three SQL Server catalogs with data-quality functionality and storage. [!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../includes/ssdqsclient-md.md)] is a SQL Server shared feature that business users, information workers, and IT professionals can use to perform computer-assisted data quality analyses and manage their data quality interactively. You can also perform data quality processes by using the [!INCLUDE[ssDQSCleansingLong](../includes/ssdqscleansinglong-md.md)] and Master Data Services (MDS) data quality functionality, both of which are based on DQS.  
  
 For information about installing DQS, see [Install Data Quality Services](install-windows/install-data-quality-services.md). If you want to upgrade your existing version of DQS to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)], see [Upgrade Data Quality Services](../database-engine/install-windows/upgrade-data-quality-services.md).
