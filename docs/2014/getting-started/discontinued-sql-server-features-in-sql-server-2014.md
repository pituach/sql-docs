# Discontinued SQL Server Features in SQL Server 2014
  This topic describes features that are no longer available after you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
## Discontinued Features in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../includes/sssql14-md.md)]  
 No discontinued features in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../includes/sssql14-md.md)].  
  
## Discontinued Features in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../includes/sssql11-md.md)]  
  
### Discontinued Active Directory Helper Service  
 The Active Directory Helper service and the related components has been removed. The following table lists the associated components that are removed are a result:  
  
|Category|Discontinued Feature|Replacement|  
|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------|  
|System Stored Procedures|sp_ActiveDirectory_Obj<br /><br /> sp_ActiveDirectory_SCP<br /><br /> sp_ActiveDirectory_Start|No replacement available|  
  
## Discontinued Features in SQL Server 2008 R2  
  
### 64-bit Platform Support in Reporting Services  
 Starting in [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] component no longer supports Itanium-based servers running Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2003 R2. [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] continues to support other 64-bit operating systems, including Windows Server°2008 for Itanium-Based Systems and Windows Server°2008°R2 for Itanium-Based Systems. To upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] from a [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] installation with [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] on an Itanium-based system edition of Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2003 R2, you must first upgrade the operating system.  
  
## Discontinued Features in SQL Server 2008  
  
### Discontinued SQL-DMO from SQL Server Express Installation  
 SQL-DMO for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has been removed from [!INCLUDE[ssExpressEd10](../includes/ssexpressed10-md.md)]. We recommend that you modify applications that currently use this feature as soon as possible. If you must support SQL-DMO for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Express, install the Backward Compatibility Components from the [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] feature pack from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=51230). Use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO) for new development work.  
  
### Discontinued Option for Web Assistant  
 The `sp_configure` option to enable Web Assistant has been removed from [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../includes/sskatmai-md.md)]. We recommend that you use [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] instead.  
  
### Surface Area Configuration Tool
