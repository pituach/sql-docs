# Getting SQL Server Assistance
  There are three principal sources of information from [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
-   The documentation installed as a local collection of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] sites on the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Developer Network (MSDN) and TechNet.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] information on additional [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Web sites.  
  
 If you do not find the information you are looking for in these sources, you can either post questions in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] community forums and newsgroups, or you can open a support case with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)].  
  
## [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online documents the concepts and procedures required to use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Books Online also includes reference material for the languages and programming interfaces for storing, retrieving, reporting, and modifying data using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 Books Online can be accessed in the following ways:  
  
-   A copy of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Books Online is published in both the MSDN Library and the TechNet Library on the Internet. The topics in these copies of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online include comments from the community, such as additional information and code examples from other customers. You can view the MSDN Library copy at the [SQL Server 2014 Books Online](../2014-toc/index.md).  
  
-   You can use the Help Library Manager to install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online on a local computer. For more information, see [Add or Remove Product Documentation for SQL Server](../2014-toc/books-online-for-sql-server-2014.md).  
  
 Both the copy of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online in the MSDN Library and the Books Online files available through Help Library Manager are refreshed when [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] publishes an update to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.  
  
## Information on MSDN and TechNet  
 The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Developer Network (MSDN) provides online and offline services that help developers write applications using [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] products and technologies. The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] TechNet Program delivers comprehensive technical resources that help IT professionals efficiently evaluate, deploy, and support [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] solutions.  
  
 Several sites on MSDN and TechNet provide a specific audience with links to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] information most relevant to their jobs, including the information in the copies of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online on MSDN or TechNet. These sites also contain information that extends the information available in SQL Server Books Online.  
  
 The following table describes these resources and their intended audience.  
  
|Resource|Audience|  
|--------------|--------------|  
|[SQL Server Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/sqlserver/)|Developers who are building [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases, reporting systems, and business intelligence solutions, and enabling their applications and Web sites to use these systems.|  
|[XML Developer Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=42458)|Web site creators and application developers whose sites and applications utilize XML for data storage and manipulation.|  
|[SQL Server TechNet Site](http://technet.microsoft.com/sqlserver/dn135309)|Administrators and operators who plan, deploy, administer, and support systems that use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|  
  
## Additional Online Information  
 Additional [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] information is available from these [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Web sites.  
  
|Resource|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|[Microsoft SQL Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8504)|Provides pre-sales information about evaluating [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as a data storage and business intelligence tool.|  
|[Microsoft Knowledge Base](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=42461)|Provides a searchable repository of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] articles written by [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.|    
  
 [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] products have a support lifecycle that defines how long support is available for each release. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] support maintains a page that defines the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] support lifecycle. The page contains links to other pages that specify the availability of support for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] products. For more information, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=98306).
