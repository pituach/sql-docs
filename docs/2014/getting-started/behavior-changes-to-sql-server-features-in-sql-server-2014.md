# Behavior Changes to SQL Server Features in SQL Server 2014
  This topic describes behavior changes you might see when you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] from a previous version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Behavior changes affect how features work or interact in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] compared to earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 Currently, there are no documented behavior changes.
