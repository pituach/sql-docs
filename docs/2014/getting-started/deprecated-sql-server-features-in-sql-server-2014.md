# Deprecated SQL Server Features in SQL Server 2014
  This topic describes the deprecated features that are still available in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. These features are scheduled to be removed in a future release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Deprecated features should not be used in new applications.  
  
## Features Not Supported in the Next Version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  
 The following [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] features will not be supported in the next version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Do not use these features in new development work, and modify applications that currently use these features as soon as possible. The Feature name column appears in trace events as the ObjectName, in performance counters and sys.dm_os_performance_counters as the instance_name. The Feature ID appears in trace events as the ObjectId.  
  
|Category|Deprecated feature|Replacement|Feature name|Feature ID|  
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|  
|Data Programmability|[sys.soap_endpoints &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-soap-endpoints-transact-sql)|Windows Communications Foundation (WCF) or ASP.NET|Native XML Web Services|22|  
|Data Programmability|[sys.endpoint_webmethods &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-endpoint-webmethods-transact-sql)|Windows Communications Foundation (WCF) or ASP.NET|Native XML Web Services|23|  
  
### Slipstream Functionality  
 The Product Update feature replaces the Slipstream functionality that was available in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] PCU1. Therefore the command-line parameters, /*PCUSource* and /*CUSource*, associated with Slipstream functionality should no longer be used. The parameters will continue to work, but may be removed in a future release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup. The /*UpdateSource* parameter combines the functionality of the Slipstream parameters, /*PCUSource* and /*CUSource*.  
  
 For more information about Slipstream functionality that was available in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] PCU1, see [Slipstream a SQL Server Update](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=219945) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=219945).
