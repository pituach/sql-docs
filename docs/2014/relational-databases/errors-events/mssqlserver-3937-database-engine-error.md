# MSSQLSERVER_3937
    
## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Event ID|3937|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|XACT_FILESTREAM_ROLLBACK_ERROR|  
|Message Text|An error occurred while trying to notify the FILESTREAM filter driver that a transaction was rolled back. Error code: 0x%0x.|  
  
## Explanation  
 An error was returned by the RsFx driver when issuing a rollback notification for a transaction. This is probably caused by a resource shortage. This can cause a small memory leak in the RsFx filter driver, but this will be freed when the sqlservr.exe process that created the transaction exits.
