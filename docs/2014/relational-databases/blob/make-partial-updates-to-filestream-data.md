# Make Partial Updates to FILESTREAM Data
  An application uses FSCTL_SQL_FILESTREAM_FETCH_OLD_CONTENT to make partial updates to FILESTREAM BLOB data. The [DeviceIoControl](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=105527) function passes this value and the handle that is returned from [OpenSqlFilestream](access-filestream-data-with-opensqlfilestream.md) to the FILESTREAM driver. The driver then forces a server-side copy of the current FILESTREAM data into the file that is referenced by the handle. If the application issues the FSCTL_SQL_FILESTREAM_FETCH_OLD_CONTENT value after the handle has been written to, the last write operation persists and previous write operations that were made to the handle are lost.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  FILESTREAM relies on the [SMB protocol](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=112454) for remote access.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows you how to use the `FSCTL_SQL_FILESTREAM_FETCH_OLD_CONTENT` value to perform a partial update of an inserted FILESTREAM BLOB.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This example requires the FILESTREAM-enabled database and table that are created in [Create a FILESTREAM-Enabled Database](create-a-filestream-enabled-database.md) and [Create a Table for Storing FILESTREAM Data](create-a-table-for-storing-filestream-data.md).
