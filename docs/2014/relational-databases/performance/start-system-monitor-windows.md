# Start System Monitor (Windows)
  Use System Monitor to monitor the utilization of system resources. Collect and view real-time performance data in the form of counters, for server resources such as processor and memory use, and for many Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resources such as locks and transactions.  
  
### To start System Monitor in Windows
