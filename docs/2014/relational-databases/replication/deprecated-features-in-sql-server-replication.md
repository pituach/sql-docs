# Deprecated Features in SQL Server Replication
  This topic describes the deprecated Replication features that are still available in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. These features are scheduled to be removed in a future release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Deprecated features should not be used in new applications.  
  
## Items Deprecated in SQL Server 2014  
  
|Feature|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)]|Replication is supported if each [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] endpoint is within two major versions of the current version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Consequently, [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] does not support replication to or from [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)].|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)]|Replication is supported if each [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] endpoint is within two major versions of the current version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Consequently, [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] does not support replication to or from [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)].|
