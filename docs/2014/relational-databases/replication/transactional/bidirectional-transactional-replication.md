# Bidirectional Transactional Replication
  Bidirectional transactional replication is a specific transactional replication topology that allows two servers to exchange changes with each other: each server publishes data and then subscribes to a publication with the same data from the other server. The **@loopback_detection** parameter of [sp_addsubscription &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-addsubscription-transact-sql) is set to TRUE to ensure that changes are only sent to the Subscriber and do not result in the change being sent back to the Publisher.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] and later versions, this topology is also supported by peer-to-peer transactional replication, but bidirectional replication can provide improved performance.
