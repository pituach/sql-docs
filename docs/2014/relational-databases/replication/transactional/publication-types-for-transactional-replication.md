# Publication Types for Transactional Replication
  Transactional replication offers three publication types:  
  
|Publication Type|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|Standard transactional publication|Appropriate for topologies in which all data at the Subscriber is read-only (transactional replication does not enforce this at the Subscriber).<br /><br /> Standard transactional publications are created by default when using Transact-SQL or Replication Management Objects (RMO). When using the New Publication Wizard, they are created by selecting **Transactional publication** on the **Publication Type** page.<br /><br /> For more information about creating publications, see [Publish Data and Database Objects](../publish/publish-data-and-database-objects.md).|  
|Transactional publication in a peer-to-peer topology|The characteristics of this publication type are:<br /><br /> Each location has identical data and acts as both a Publisher and Subscriber.<br /><br /> The same row can be changed only at one location at a time.<br /><br /> This topology is best suited for server environments requiring high availability and read scalability.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> For more information, see [Peer-to-Peer Transactional Replication](peer-to-peer-transactional-replication.md).|
