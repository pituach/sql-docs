# Execute Scripts Before and After a Snapshot Is Applied (SQL Server Management Studio)
  Specify an optional script to execute before or after the snapshot is applied on the **Snapshot** page of the **Publication Properties - \<Publication>** dialog box. For more information about accessing this dialog box, see [View and Modify Publication Properties](publish/view-and-modify-publication-properties.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  These options are not available if the **Snapshot format** option is set to **Character**.  
  
### To execute a script before or after a snapshot is applied  
  
1.  On the **Snapshot** page of the **Publication Properties - \<Publication>** dialog box:  
  
    -   To specify a script to execute before the snapshot is applied, click **Browse** to navigate to the script, or enter a path to the script in the **Before applying the snapshot, execute this script** text box.  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  The Distribution Agent or Merge Agent must have read permissions for the directory you specify. If pull subscriptions are used, you must specify a shared directory as a universal naming convention (UNC) path, such as \\\computername\scripts\myscript.sql.  
  
    -   To specify a script to execute after the snapshot is applied, click **Browse** to navigate to the script, or enter a UNC path to the script in the **After applying the snapshot, execute this script** text box.  
  
2.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../includes/clickok-md.md)]
