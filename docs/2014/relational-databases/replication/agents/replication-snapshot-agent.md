## Arguments  
 **-?**  
 Prints all available parameters.  
  
 **-Publisher**  *server_name*[**\\***instance_name*]  
 Is the name of the Publisher. Specify server_name for the default instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on that server. Specify *server_name***\\***instance_name* for a named instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on that server.  
  
 **-Publication** *publication*  
 Is the name of the publication. This parameter is only valid if the publication is set to always have a snapshot available for new or reinitialized subscriptions.  
  
 **-70Subscribers**  
 Must be used if any Subscribers are running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] version 7.0.  
  
 **-BcpBatchSize** *bcp*_ *batch*\_ *size*  
 Is the number of rows to send in a bulk copy operation. When performing a **bcp in** operation, the batch size is the number of rows to send to the server as one transaction, and also the number of rows that must be sent before the Distribution Agent logs a **bcp** progress message. When performing a **bcp out** operation, a fixed batch size of 1000 is used. A value of 0 indicates no message logging.  
  
 **-DefinitionFile** *def_path_and_file_name*  
 Is the path of the agent definition file. An agent definition file contains command line arguments for the agent. The content of the file is parsed as an executable file. Use double quotation marks (") to specify argument values containing arbitrary characters.  
  
 **-Distributor** *server_name*[**\\***instance_name*]  
 Is the Distributor name. Specify *server_name* for the default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on that server. Specify *server_name***\\***instance_name* for a named instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on that server.  
  
 **-DistributorDeadlockPriority** [**-1**|**0**|**1**]  
 Is the priority of the Snapshot Agent connection to the Distributor when a deadlock occurs. This parameter is specified to resolve deadlocks that may occur between the Snapshot Agent and user applications during snapshot generation.  
  
|DistributorDeadlockPriority value|Description|  
|---------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**-1**|Applications other than the Snapshot Agent have priority when a deadlock occurs at the Distributor.|  
|**0** (Default)|Priority is not assigned.|  
|**1**|Snapshot Agent has priority when a deadlock occurs at the Distributor.|  
  
 **-DistributorLogin** *distributor_login*  
 Is the login used when connecting to the Distributor using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.  
  
 **-DistributorPassword** *distributor_password*  
 Is the password used when connecting to the Distributor using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication. .  
  
 **-DistributorSecurityMode** [ **0**| **1**]  
 Specifies the security mode of the Distributor. A value of **0** indicates [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication Mode (default), and a value of **1** indicates Windows Authentication Mode.  
  
 **-DynamicFilterHostName** *dynamic_filter_host_name*  
 Is used to set a value for [HOST_NAME &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/t-sql/functions/host-name-transact-sql) in filtering when a dynamic snapshot is created. For example, if the subset filter clause `rep_id = HOST_NAME()` is specified for an article, and you set the **DynamicFilterHostName** property to "FBJones" before calling the Merge Agent, only rows having "FBJones" in the **rep_id** column will be replicated.  
  
 **-DynamicFilterLogin** *dynamic_filter_login*  
 Is used to set a value for [SUSER_SNAME &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/t-sql/functions/suser-sname-transact-sql)in filtering when a dynamic snapshot is created. For example, if the subset filter clause `user_id = SUSER_SNAME()` is specified for an article, and you set the **DynamicFilterLogin** property to "rsmith" before calling the **Run** method of the **SQLSnapshot** object, only rows having "rsmith" in the **user_id** column will be included in the snapshot.  
  
 **-DynamicSnapshotLocation** *dynamic_snapshot_location*  
 Is the location where the dynamic snapshot should be generated.  
  
 **-EncryptionLevel** [ **0** | **1** | **2** ]  
 Is the level of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption used by the Snapshot Agent when making connections.  
  
|EncryptionLevel value|Description|  
|---------------------------|-----------------|  
|**0**|Specifies that SSL is not used.|  
|**1**|Specifies that SSL is used, but the agent does not verify that the SSL server certificate is signed by a trusted issuer.|  
|**2**|Specifies that SSL is used, and that the certificate is verified.|  
  
 For more information, see [Security Overview &#40;Replication&#41;](../security/security-overview-replication.md).  
  
 **-FieldDelimiter** *field_delimiter*  
 Is the character or character sequence that marks the end of a field in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] bulk-copy data file. The default is \n\<x$3>\n.  
  
 **-HistoryVerboseLevel** [ **1**| **2**| **3**]  
 Specifies the amount of history logged during a snapshot operation. You can minimize the effect of history logging on performance by selecting **1**.  
  
|HistoryVerboseLevel value|Description|  
|-------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**0**|Progress messages are written either to the console or to an output file. History records are not logged in the distribution database.|  
|**1**|Always update a previous history message of the same status (startup, progress, success, and so on). If no previous record with the same status exists, insert a new record.|  
|**2** (default)|Insert new history records unless the record is for such things as idle messages or long-running job messages, in which case update the previous records.|  
|**3**|Always insert new records, unless it is for idle messages.|  
  
 **-HRBcpBlocks** *number_of_blocks*  
 Is the number of **bcp** data blocks that are queued between the writer and reader threads. The default value is 50. **HRBcpBlocks** is only used with Oracle publications.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This parameter is used for performance tuning of **bcp** performance from an Oracle Publisher.  
  
 -**HRBcpBlockSize***block_size*  
 Is the size, in kilobytes (KB), of each **bcp** data block. The default value is 64 KB. **HRBcpBlocks** is only used with Oracle publications.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This parameter is used for performance tuning of **bcp** performance from an Oracle Publisher.  
  
 **-HRBcpDynamicBlocks**  
 Is whether or not the size of each **bcp** data block can grow dynamically. **HRBcpBlocks** is only used with Oracle publications.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This parameter is used for performance tuning of **bcp** performance from an Oracle Publisher.  
  
 **-KeepAliveMessageInterval** *keep_alive_interval*  
 Is the amount of time, in seconds, that the Snapshot Agent waits before logging "waiting for backend message" to the [MSsnapshot_history](/sql/relational-databases/system-tables/mssnapshot-history-transact-sql) table. The default value is 300 seconds.  
  
 **-LoginTimeOut** *login_time_out_seconds*  
 Is the number of seconds before the login times out. The default is **15** seconds.  
  
 **-MaxBcpThreads** *number_of_threads*  
 Specifies the number of bulk copy operations that can be performed in parallel. The maximum number of threads and ODBC connections that exist simultaneously is the lesser of **MaxBcpThreads** or the number of bulk copy requests that appear in the synchronization transaction in the distribution database. **MaxBcpThreads** must have a value greater than **0** and has no hard-coded upper limit. The default is **1**.  
  
 \- **MaxNetworkOptimization** [ **0**| **1**]  
 Is if irrelevant deletes are sent to the Subscriber. Irrelevant deletes are DELETE commands that are sent to Subscribers for rows that do not belong to the Subscriber's partition. Irrelevant deletes do not affect data integrity or convergence, but they can result in unnecessary network traffic. The default value of **MaxNetworkOptimization** is **0**. Setting **MaxNetworkOptimization** to **1** minimizing the chances of irrelevant deletes thereby reducing network traffic and maximizing network optimization. Setting this parameter to **1** can also increase the storage of metadata and cause performance to degrade at the Publisher if multiple levels of join filters and complex subset filters are present. You should carefully assess your replication topology and set **MaxNetworkOptimization** to **1** only if network traffic from irrelevant deletes is unacceptably high.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Setting this parameter to **1** is useful only when the synchronization optimization option of the merge publication is set to **true** (the **@keep_partition_changes** parameter of [sp_addmergepublication &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-addmergepublication-transact-sql)).  
  
 **-Output** *output_path_and_file_name*  
 Is the path of the agent output file. If the file name is not provided, the output is sent to the console. If the specified file name exists, the output is appended to the file.  
  
 **-OutputVerboseLevel** [ **0**| **1**| **2**]  
 Specifies whether the output should be verbose.  
  
|OutputVerboseLevel value|Description|  
|------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**0**|Only error messages are printed.|  
|**1** (default)|All the progress report messages are printed (default).|  
|**2**|All error messages and progress report messages are printed, which is useful for debugging.|  

 **-PrefetchTables** [ **0**| **1**]  
 Optional parameter that specifies if the table objects will be prefetched and cached.  The default behavior is to prefetch certain table properties using SMO component based on an internal calculation.  This parameter can be helpful in scenarions where SMO prefetch operation takes considerable longer to run. If this parameter is not used, this decision is made at runtime based on the percentage of tables that are added as articles to the publication.  
  
|OutputVerboseLevel value|Description|  
|------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**0**|Call to Prefetch method of SMO component is disabled.|  
|**1**|Snapshot Agent will call Prefetch method to cache some table properties using SMO|  
  
 **-PacketSize** *packet_size*  
 Is the packet size (in bytes) used by the Snapshot Agent when connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The default value is 8192 bytes.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Do not change the packet size unless you are certain that it will improve performance. For most applications, the default packet size is best.  
  
 **-ProfileName** *profile_name*  
 Specifies an agent profile to use for agent parameters. If **ProfileName** is NULL, the agent profile is disabled. If **ProfileName** is not specified, the default profile for the agent type is used. For information, see [Replication Agent Profiles](replication-agent-profiles.md).  
  
 **-PublisherDB** *publisher_database*  
 Is the name of the publication database. *This parameter is not supported for Oracle Publishers*.  
  
 **-PublisherDeadlockPriority** [**-1**|**0**|**1**]  
 Is the priority of the Snapshot Agent connection to the Publisher when a deadlock occurs. This parameter is specified to resolve deadlocks that may occur between the Snapshot Agent and user applications during snapshot generation.  
  
|PublisherDeadlockPriority value|Description|  
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**-1**|Applications other than the Snapshot Agent have priority when a deadlock occurs at the Publisher.|  
|**0** (Default)|Priority is not assigned.|  
|**1**|Snapshot Agent has priority when a deadlock occurs at the Publisher.|  
  
 **-PublisherFailoverPartner** *server_name*[**\\***instance_name*]  
 Specifies the failover partner instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] participating in a database mirroring session with the publication database. For more information, see [Database Mirroring and Replication &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/database-mirroring/database-mirroring-and-replication-sql-server.md).  
  
 **-PublisherLogin** *publisher_login*

 **-PublisherPassword**  *publisher_password*  
 Is the password used when connecting to the Publisher using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication. .  
  
 **-PublisherSecurityMode** [ **0**| **1**]  
 Specifies the security mode of the Publisher. A value of **0** indicates [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication (default), and a value of **1** indicates Windows Authentication Mode.  
  
 **-QueryTimeOut** *query_time_out_seconds*  
 Is the number of seconds before the query times out. The default is 1800 seconds.  
  
 **-ReplicationType** [ **1**| **2**]  
 Specifies the type of replication. A value of **1** indicates transactional replication, and a value of **2** indicates merge replication.  
  
 **-RowDelimiter** *row_delimiter*  
 Is the character or character sequence that marks the end of a row in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] bulk-copy data file. The default is \n\<,@g>\n.  
  
 **-StartQueueTimeout** *start_queue_timeout_seconds*  
 Is the maximum number of seconds that the Snapshot Agent waits when the number of concurrent dynamic snapshot processes running is at the limit set by the **@max_concurrent_dynamic_snapshots** property of [sp_addmergepublication &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-addmergepublication-transact-sql). If the maximum number of seconds is reached and the Snapshot Agent is still waiting, it will exit. A value of 0 means that the agent waits indefinitely, although it can be canceled.  
  
 \- **UsePerArticleContentsView** *use_per_article_contents_view*  
 This parameter has been deprecated and is supported for backward-compatibility only.  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have installed [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent to run under a Local System account rather than under a Domain User account (the default), the service can access only the local computer. If the Snapshot Agent that runs under [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent is configured to use Windows Authentication Mode when it logs in to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the Snapshot Agent fails. The default setting is [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.  
  
 To start the Snapshot Agent, execute **snapshot.exe** from the command prompt. For information, see [Replication Agent Executables](../concepts/replication-agent-executables-concepts.md).
