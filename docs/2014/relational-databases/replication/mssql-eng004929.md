# MSSQL_ENG004929
    
## Message Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|4929|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|[!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]|  
|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|Cannot alter the %S_MSG '%.*ls' because it is being published for replication.|  
  
## Explanation  
 This error typically occurs if you attempt to drop the primary key constraint on a table that is published for transactional replication. Transactional replication requires a primary key for each published table; therefore the constraint cannot be dropped.  
  
## User Action  
 To drop the constraint, first drop the article associated with the table. For more information, see [Add Articles to and Drop Articles from Existing Publications](publish/add-articles-to-and-drop-articles-from-existing-publications.md). If this error occurs in a database that is not replicated, execute [sp_removedbreplication &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-removedbreplication-transact-sql) to ensure objects in the database are not marked as replicated.
