# Subscriber Types
  Merge replication allows you to specify the types of Subscribers that a publication must support. Selecting Subscriber types sets the *publication compatibility level*, which determines which features can be used by a publication.  
  
 After a publication snapshot is created, the publication compatibility level can be increased (made more restrictive) on the **General** page of the **Publication Properties** dialog box; the compatibility level cannot be decreased.  
  
## Options  
 Select each Subscriber type that this publication must support.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]  
 The publication can use all features.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)]  
 The publication requires snapshot files to be in character format (this is handled automatically by the Snapshot Agent). [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] also has a number of restrictions not related to compatibility level.  
  
 If this option is selected, the Web synchronization option is enabled for the publication. For more information about Web synchronization, see [Web Synchronization for Merge Replication](web-synchronization-for-merge-replication.md).
