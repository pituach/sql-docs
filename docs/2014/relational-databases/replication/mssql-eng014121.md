# MSSQL_ENG014121
    
## Message Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|14121|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|[!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]|  
|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|Could not drop the Distributor '%s'. This Distributor has associated distribution databases.|  
  
## Explanation  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance that is configured as a Distributor cannot be removed from the role of Distributor because there are distribution databases associated with the instance. This error occurs if you attempt to drop a distribution database that is associated with one or more Publishers.  
  
## User Action  
 To find the names of any Publishers and distribution databases associated with this Distributor, execute [sp_helpdistpublisher &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-helpdistpublisher-transact-sql) from any database on the Distributor.  
  
 Execute [sp_dropdistributiondb &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-dropdistributiondb-transact-sql) for any distribution databases associated with this Distributor. After all distribution database associations are removed, you can disable distribution.
