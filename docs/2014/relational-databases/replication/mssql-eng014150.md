## Explanation  
 This message indicates that a replication agent has successfully finished running. Replication uses the following agents:  
  
-   The Snapshot Agent. This agent is used by all publications.  
  
-   The Log Reader Agent. This agent is used by all transactional publications.  
  
-   The Queue Reader Agent. This agent is used by transactional publications enabled for queued updating subscriptions.  
  
-   The Distribution Agent. This agent synchronizes subscriptions to transactional and snapshot publications.  
  
-   The Merge Agent. This agent synchronizes subscriptions to merge publications.  
  
-   Replication maintenance jobs.  
  
## User Action  
 The Log Reader Agent, Queue Reader Agent, and Distribution Agent typically run continuously, whereas the other agents typically run on demand or on a schedule. If you do not expect an agent to have completed a run, check the status of the agent. For more information, see [Monitor Replication Agents](agents/replication-agents.md).
