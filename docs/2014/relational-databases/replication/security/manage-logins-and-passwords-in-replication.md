# Manage Logins and Passwords in Replication
  Specify the logins and passwords for replication agents when you configure replication. After configuring replication, you can change logins and passwords. For more information, see [View and Modify Replication Security Settings](view-and-modify-replication-security-settings.md). If you change the password for an account used by a replication agent, execute [sp_changereplicationserverpasswords &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-changereplicationserverpasswords-transact-sql).
