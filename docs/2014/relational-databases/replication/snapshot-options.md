# Snapshot Options
  There are a number of options available when initializing a subscription with a snapshot:  
  
-   Specify an alternate snapshot folder location instead of or in addition to the default snapshot folder location. For more information, see [Alternate Snapshot Folder Locations](alternate-snapshot-folder-locations.md).  
  
-   Compress snapshots for storage on removable media or for transfer over a slow network. For more information, see [Compressed Snapshots](compressed-snapshots.md).  
  
-   Execute [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] scripts before or after the snapshot is applied. For more information, see [Execute Scripts Before and After the Snapshot Is Applied](execute-scripts-before-and-after-the-snapshot-is-applied.md).  
  
-   Transfer snapshot files using File Transfer Protocol (FTP). For more information, see [Transfer Snapshots Through FTP](transfer-snapshots-through-ftp.md).
