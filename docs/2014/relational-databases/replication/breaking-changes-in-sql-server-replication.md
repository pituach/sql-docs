# Breaking Changes in SQL Server Replication
  This topic describes breaking changes in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Replication. These changes might break applications, scripts, or functionalities that are based on earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You might encounter these issues when you upgrade. For more information, see [Use Upgrade Advisor to Prepare for Upgrades](../../sql-server/install/use-upgrade-advisor-to-prepare-for-upgrades.md).  
  
## Breaking Changes Made in SQL Server 2014  
 [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] does not support replication to or from [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)].
