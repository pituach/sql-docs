# SQL Server Native Client (OLE DB) Reference
  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider exposes interfaces to consumers wanting access to data on one or more computers running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider is an OLE DB version 2.0â€“compliant provider.  
  
 This [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider programming reference does not document all of the OLE DB interfaces and methods, only those interfaces and methods that exhibit provider-specific behavior when using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider.  
  
 For a full description of the core OLE DB interfaces and methods, see the [OLE DB Programmer's Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=45232).
