# Installing SMO
  If you want to develop an application that uses [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO), you should select the Client Tools SDK when you install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. To install the Client Tooks SDK without installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], install Shared Management Objects from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] feature pack. If you want to ensure that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects is installed on a computer that will run your application, you can use the Shared Management Objects .msi in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] feature pack.  
  
 By default, the SMO assemblies are installed in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampPathSDK](../../includes/sssamppathsdk-md.md)] directory.
