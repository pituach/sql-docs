# Programming Languages
  This section describes how to program [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO) in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual Basic .NET, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual C# .NET, and [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual C++.  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Getting Started in Visual Basic .NET](../../database-engine/dev-guide/getting-started-in-visual-basic-net.md)|Provides information on how to start writing an SMO program in Visual Basic .NET|  
|[Getting Started in Visual C&#35; .NET](smo-programming-getting-started-in-visual-csharp-net.md)|Provides information on how to start writing an SMO program in Visual C# .NET|  
  
 SMO is a .NET assembly. To program by using the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework, you must choose a language that is supported by the common language runtime. In the SMO reference, there is syntax for managed languages such as Visual Basic .NET and Visual C# .NET.
