# Quick Info (IntelliSense)
  The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] IntelliSense **Quick Info** option displays the complete declaration for any identifier in your code. When you move the mouse pointer over an identifier, its declaration is displayed in a yellow pop-up window. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], **Quick Info** is available in the Database Engine and XML Query Editors.  
  
## Transact-SQL Quick Info  
 **Quick Info** displays two types of information in the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] Query Editor. When not in debug mode, **Quick Info** displays the expression declaration. When in debug mode, **Quick Info** instead displays the name of the expression and its current value.  
  
 In the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] Query Editor, **Quick Info** is available only for those parts of the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] syntax that IntelliSense supports. For example, if you move the mouse pointer over the identifier for an object that has a data type that IntelliSense does not support, the **Quick Info** pop-up window contains a message that states that the data type is not supported.
