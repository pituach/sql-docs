# Drag and Drop Text
  You can select text and then drag and drop it in another location. You can drag and drop text:  
  
-   From Object Explorer into the editor to create a query.  
  
-   From one location to a different location in the current editor.  
  
-   Between editors.  
  
-   To the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Recycle Bin.  
  
### To drag and drop text  
  
1.  Select the text you want to move, either with the mouse or with the keyboard.  
  
2.  Left-click the highlighted text and continue holding down the mouse button.  
  
3.  Move the mouse cursor to the destination where you want to place the text.  
  
4.  Release the mouse button to drop the text.  
  
 Dragging text moves it; that is, the text is erased from the old location and moved to the new location. Pressing the CTRL key while dragging text copies it to the new location. Dragging an object from Object Explorer is an exception and does not delete the object name from Object Explorer.
