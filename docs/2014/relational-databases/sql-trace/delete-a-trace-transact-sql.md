# Delete a Trace (Transact-SQL)
  This topic describes how to use stored procedures to delete a trace.  
  
 For an example of using trace stored procedures, see [Create a Trace &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](create-a-trace-transact-sql.md).  
  
### To delete a trace  
  
1.  Execute **sp_trace_setstatus** by specifying **@status = 0** to stop the trace.  
  
2.  Execute **sp_trace_setstatus** by specifying **@status = 2** to close the trace and delete its information from the server.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  A trace must be stopped first before it can be closed.
