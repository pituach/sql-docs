# Lesson 9. Restore a database from Windows Azure Storage
  In this lesson, you will learn how to restore a database backup file from Windows Azure Storage to a database, which either resides on-premises or in a virtual machine in Windows Azure. To follow this lesson, you do not need to complete Lesson 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  
  
 This lesson assumes that you already completed the following steps:  
  
-   You have created a database in the source machine.  
  
-   You have created a backup of your database (.bak) in Windows Azure Storage by using the [SQL Server Backup and Restore with Windows Azure Blob Storage Service](backup-restore/sql-server-backup-and-restore-with-microsoft-azure-blob-storage-service.md) feature. Note that you will need to create another SQL Server Credential in this step. This credential uses storage account keys.  
  
-   You have a Windows Azure Storage account.  
  
-   You have created a container under your Windows Azure Storage account.  
  
-   You have created a policy on a container with read, write, and list rights. You also generated a SAS key.  
  
-   You have created a SQL Server credential on your machine for Windows Azure Storage Integration feature. Note that this credential requires a Shared Access Signature (SAS) key.  
  
 To restore a database from Windows Azure Storage, you can follow these steps:  
  
1.  Start SQL Server Management Studio. Connect to the default instance.  
  
2.  Click **New Query** on the Standard Toolbar.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following complete script to the query window. Modify the script as needed.  
  
     **Note:** You run the `RESTORE` statement to restore the database backup (.bak) in Windows Azure Storage to a database instance in another machine.  
  
    ```tsql  
  
    USE master   
    GO   
    -- Create a new database to be backed up.   
    CREATE DATABASE TestDbRestoreFrom;   
    GO   
    USE TestDbRestoreFrom;   
    GO   
    CREATE TABLE Table1 (Col1 int primary key, Col2 varchar(20));   
    GO   
    INSERT INTO Table1 (Col1, Col2) VALUES (1, 'string1'), (2, 'string2');   
    GO   
    USE TestDbRestoreFrom;   
    GO   
    SELECT * from dbo.Table1;   
    GO   
    -- Create a credential to be used by SQL Server Backup and Restore with Windows Azure -----Blob Storage Service.   
    USE master;   
    GO   
    CREATE CREDENTIAL BackupCredential    
    WITH IDENTITY= 'teststorageaccnt',   
    SECRET = 'BO1nH/lWRdnc8TGPlQIXmGLWVCoEa48suYSGiAlC73+S0TX5VXo5/LCm8qiyGCYafDg4ZsueDIV3GQ5RXHaRGw=='    
    GO   
    -- Display the newly created credential   
    SELECT * from sys.credentials   
    -- Create a backup in Windows Azure Storage.   
    BACKUP DATABASE TestDBRestoreFrom    
    TO URL = 'https://teststorageaccnt.blob.core.windows.net/testrestorefrom/TestDBRestoreFrom.bak'    
          WITH CREDENTIAL = 'BackupCredential'    
         ,COMPRESSION   
         ,STATS = 5;   
    GO    
    -- Create a Shared Access Signature credential   
    CREATE CREDENTIAL [https://teststorageaccnt.blob.core.windows.net/testrestorefrom]   
    WITH IDENTITY='SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE',   
    SECRET = 'sv=2012-02-12&sr=c&si=policy_resfrom&sig=EhVpzLUXjG4ThAMLmVhrnoiCt8IfmD3BsuYiMawGzxc%3D'   
    GO   
    USE master;   
    GO   
    RESTORE DATABASE TestDBRestoreFrom    
    FROM URL = 'https://teststorageaccnt.blob.core.windows.net/testrestorefrom/TestDBRestoreFrom.bak'    
    WITH    
    CREDENTIAL = 'BackupCredential',    
    REPLACE,   
    MOVE 'TestDBRestoreFrom' TO 'C:\Backup\TestDBRestoreFrom.mdf',     
    MOVE 'TestDBRestoreFrom_log' TO 'C:\Backup\TestDBRestoreFrom_log.ldf';   
    GO  
  
    ```
