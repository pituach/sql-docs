# Migrating Triggers
  This topic discusses DDL and DML triggers and memory-optimized tables.  
  
 LOGON triggers are triggers defined to fire on LOGON events. LOGON triggers do not affect memory-optimized tables.  
  
## DDL Triggers  
 DDL triggers are triggers defined to fire when a CREATE, ALTER, DROP, GRANT, DENY, REVOKE, or UPDATE STATISTICS statement is executed on the database or server on which it is defined.  
  
 You cannot create memory-optimized tables if the database or server has one or more DDL trigger defined on CREATE_TABLE or any event group that includes it. You cannot drop a memory-optimized table if the database or server has one or more DDL trigger defined on DROP_TABLE or any event group that includes it.  
  
 You cannot create natively compiled stored procedures if there are one or more DDL triggers on CREATE_PROCEDURE, DROP_PROCEDURE, or any event group that includes those events.  
  
## DML Triggers  
 DML triggers cannot be defined on memory-optimized tables. However, In-Memory OLTP allows you to achieve an effect similar to DML triggers if you explicitly use stored procedures to insert, update, or delete data. If your system contains ad-hoc queries, convert them to use these stored procedures instead to simulate the effect of DML triggers.  
  
 Depending on the trigger event (FOR/AFTER or INSTEAD OF), you may include the content of the trigger in the appropriate stored procedure that performs INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on that table. For example, when migrating an AFTER INSERT trigger, you could alter the stored procedure that performs the insert operation by including the content of the trigger after the appropriate INSERT statement.  
  
 You can use an interpreted stored procedure or a natively compiled stored procedure. Most [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] constructs in an interpreted stored procedure can execute on a memory-optimized table. However, only a subset of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] constructs are supported in natively compiled stored procedures. For information on [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] support on memory-optimized tables, see [Accessing Memory-Optimized Tables Using Interpreted Transact-SQL](accessing-memory-optimized-tables-using-interpreted-transact-sql.md). For information on [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] support in natively compiled stored procedures, see [Transact-SQL Constructs Not Supported by In-Memory OLTP](transact-sql-constructs-not-supported-by-in-memory-oltp.md).  
  
 The following is a simple example of simulating DML trigger behavior on a memory-optimized table.  
  
 The database contains the following objects, scripted as CREATE TABLE, CREATE TRIGGER, and CREATE PROCEDURE statements:  
  
```tsql  
CREATE TABLE OrderDetails  
(  
   OrderId int not null primary key,  
   ProductId int not null,  
   SalePrice money not null,  
   Quantity int not null,  
   Total money not null,  
   IsDeleted bit not null DEFAULT (0)  
)  
GO  
  
CREATE TRIGGER tr_order_details_insteadof_insert  
ON OrderDetails  
INSTEAD OF INSERT AS  
BEGIN  
   DECLARE @pid int, @qty_buy int, @qty_remain int  
   SELECT @pid = ProductId, @qty_buy = Quantity FROM inserted  
   SELECT @qty_remain = Quantity FROM Inventory WHERE ProductId = @pid  
   IF (@qty_remain <= @qty_buy)  
      THROW 51000, N'Insufficient inventory!', 1  
   ELSE  
   BEGIN  
      INSERT INTO dbo.OrderDetails (OrderId, ProductId, SalePrice, Quantity, Total)   
      SELECT OrderId, ProductId, SalePrice, Quantity, Total FROM inserted  
      UPDATE Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - @qty_buy WHERE ProductId = @pid  
   END  
END  
GO  
  
CREATE TRIGGER tr_order_details_after_update  
ON OrderDetails  
AFTER UPDATE AS  
BEGIN  
   INSERT INTO UpdateNotifications (OrderId, UpdateTime) SELECT OrderId, GETDATE() FROM inserted     
END  
GO  
  
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_insert_order_details   
   @OrderId int, @ProductId int, @SalePrice money, @Quantity int, @total money  
AS BEGIN  
   INSERT INTO dbo.OrderDetails (OrderId, ProductId, SalePrice, Quantity, Total)  
   VALUES (@OrderId, @ProductId, @SalePrice, @Quantity, @total)  
END  
GO  
  
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_update_order_details_by_id  
   @OrderId int, @ProductId int, @SalePrice money, @Quantity int, @Total money  
AS BEGIN  
   UPDATE dbo.OrderDetails   
   SET ProductId = @ProductId, SalePrice = @SalePrice, Quantity = @Quantity, Total = @total  
   WHERE OrderId = @OrderId  
END  
GO  
```  
  
 The following objects are functionally equivalent to the pre-migration state:  
  
```tsql  
CREATE TABLE OrderDetails  
(  
   OrderId int not null PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED HASH WITH (BUCKET_COUNT = 1048576),  
   ProductId int not null,  
   SalePrice money not null,  
   Quantity int not null,  
   Total money not null,  
   IsDeleted bit not null DEFAULT (0)  
) WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON, DURABILITY = SCHEMA_AND_DATA)  
GO  
  
CREATE TABLE Inventory  
(  
   ProductId int not null PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED,  
   Quantity int not null  
) WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON, DURABILITY = SCHEMA_AND_DATA)  
GO  
  
CREATE TABLE UpdateNotifications  
(  
   OrderId int not null,  
   UpdateTime datetime2 not null  
   CONSTRAINT pk_updateNotifications PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED (OrderId, UpdateTime)  
) WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON, DURABILITY = SCHEMA_AND_DATA)  
GO  
  
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_insert_order_details   
   @OrderId int, @ProductId int, @SalePrice money, @Quantity int, @total money  
WITH NATIVE_COMPILATION, SCHEMABINDING, EXECUTE AS OWNER  
AS BEGIN ATOMIC WITH (TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL = SNAPSHOT, LANGUAGE = N'English')  
   DECLARE @qty_remain int  
   SELECT @qty_remain = Quantity FROM dbo.Inventory WHERE ProductId = @ProductId  
   IF (@qty_remain <= @Quantity)  
      THROW 51000, N'Insufficient inventory!', 1  
   ELSE  
   BEGIN  
      INSERT INTO dbo.OrderDetails (OrderId, ProductId, SalePrice, Quantity, Total)   
      VALUES (@OrderId, @ProductId, @SalePrice, @Quantity, @total)  
      UPDATE dbo.Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - @Quantity WHERE ProductId = @ProductId  
   END  
END  
GO  
  
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_update_order_details_by_id  
   @OrderId int, @ProductId int, @SalePrice money, @Quantity int, @Total money  
WITH NATIVE_COMPILATION, SCHEMABINDING, EXECUTE AS OWNER  
AS BEGIN ATOMIC WITH (TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL = SNAPSHOT, LANGUAGE = N'English')  
   UPDATE dbo.OrderDetails   
   SET ProductId = @ProductId, SalePrice = @SalePrice, Quantity = @Quantity, Total = @total  
   WHERE OrderId = @OrderId  
   INSERT INTO dbo.UpdateNotifications (OrderId, UpdateTime) VALUES (@OrderId, GETDATE())  
END  
GO  
```
