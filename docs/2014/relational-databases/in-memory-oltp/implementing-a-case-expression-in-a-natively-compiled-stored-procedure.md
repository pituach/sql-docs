# Implementing a CASE Statement
  Case statements are not supported in natively compiled stored procedures. The following sample shows a way to implement the functionality of a case statement in a natively compiled stored procedure.  
  
 The samples uses a table variable to construct a single result set, which is only suitable when processing a limited number of rows, as it involves creating an additional copy of the data rows.  
  
 You should test the performance of this workaround, to be sure that it performs as expected in your application.  
  
```  
-- original query  
SELECT   
   SalesOrderID,   
   CASE (OnlineOrderFlag)   
   WHEN 1 THEN N'Order placed online by customer'  
   ELSE N'Order placed by sales person'  
   END  
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader_inmem  
  
--  workaround for CASE in natively compiled stored procedures  
--  use a table for the single resultset  
CREATE TYPE dbo.SOHOnlineOrderResult AS TABLE  
(  
   SalesOrderID uniqueidentifier not null index ix_SalesOrderID,  
     OrderFlag nvarchar(100) not null  
) with (memory_optimized=on)  
go  
  
-- natively compiled stored procedure that includes the query  
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.usp_SOHOnlineOrderResult  
   WITH NATIVE_COMPILATION, SCHEMABINDING, EXECUTE AS OWNER  
   AS BEGIN ATOMIC WITH  
      (TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL = SNAPSHOT, LANGUAGE=N'us_english')  
  
   -- table variable for creating the single resultset  
   DECLARE @result dbo.SOHOnlineOrderResult  
  
   -- CASE OnlineOrderFlag=1  
   INSERT @result   
   SELECT SalesOrderID, N'Order placed online by customer'  
      FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader_inmem  
      WHERE OnlineOrderFlag=1  
  
   -- ELSE  
   INSERT @result   
   SELECT SalesOrderID, placed by sales person'  
      FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader_inmem  
      WHERE OnlineOrderFlag!=1  
  
   -- return single resultset  
   SELECT SalesOrderID, OrderFlag FROM @result  
END  
GO  
  
EXEC dbo.usp_SOHOnlineOrderResult  
GO  
```
