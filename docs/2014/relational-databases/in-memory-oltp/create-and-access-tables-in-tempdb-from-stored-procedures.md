# Creating and Accessing Tables in TempDB from Natively Compiled Stored Procedures
  Creating and accessing tables in TempDB from natively compiled stored procedures is not supported. Instead, use table types and table variables. For example:  
  
```tsql  
CREATE TYPE dbo.OrderQuantityByProduct   
  AS TABLE   
   (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED HASH WITH (BUCKET_COUNT=100000),   
    ProductID INT NOT NULL,   
    Quantity INT NOT NULL) WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED=ON)  
GO  
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.usp_OrderQuantityByProduct   
WITH NATIVE_COMPILATION, SCHEMABINDING, EXECUTE AS OWNER  
AS BEGIN ATOMIC WITH   
(  
    TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL = SNAPSHOT,  
    LANGUAGE = 'english'  
)  
  -- declare table variables for the list of orders   
  DECLARE @Input dbo.OrderQuantityByProduct  
  
  -- populate input  
  INSERT @Input SELECT ProductID, Quantity FROM dbo.[Order Details]  
  end  
```
