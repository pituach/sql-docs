# Transact-SQL Constructs Not Supported by In-Memory OLTP
  Memory-optimized tables and natively compiled stored procedures do not support the full [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] surface area that is supported by disk-based tables and interpreted [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] stored procedures. When attempting to use one of the unsupported features, the server returns an error.  
  
 The error message text mentions the type of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement (feature, operation, option, for example) and well as the name of the feature or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] keyword. Most unsupported features will return error 10794, with the error message text indicating the unsupported feature. The following tables list the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] features and keywords that can appear in the error message text, as well as the corrective action to resolve the error.  
  
 For more information on supported features with memory-optimized tables and natively compiled stored procedures, see:
