# Administer Multiple Servers Using Central Management Servers
  You can administer multiple servers by designating Central Management Servers and creating server groups.  
  
## Benefits of Central Management Servers and Server Groups  
 An instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that is designated as a Central Management Server maintains server groups that contain the connection information for one or more instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements and Policy-Based Management policies can be executed at the same time against server groups. You can also view the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] log files on instances that are managed through a Central Management Server. Versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that are earlier than [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] cannot be designated as a Central Management Server.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements can also be executed against local server groups in Registered Servers.  
  
### Related Tasks  
 To create a Central Management Server and server groups, use the **Registered Servers** window in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. Note that the Central Management Server cannot be a member of a group that it maintains. For more information about how to create Central Management Servers and server groups, see [Create a Central Management Server and Server Group &#40;SQL Server Management Studio&#41;](../ssms/register-servers/create-a-central-management-server-and-server-group.md).
