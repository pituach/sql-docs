# CLR User-Defined Functions
  User-defined functions are routines that can take parameters, perform calculations or other actions, and return a result. Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)], you can write user-defined functions in any [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework programming language, such as [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual Basic .NET or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual C#.  
  
 There are two types of functions: scalar, which returns a single value, and table-valued, which returns a set of rows.  
  
 The following table lists the topics in this section.  
  
 [CLR Scalar-Valued Functions](clr-scalar-valued-functions.md)  
 Covers implementation requirements and examples of scalar-valued functions.  
  
 [CLR Table-Valued Functions](clr-table-valued-functions.md)  
 Discusses how to implement and use table-valued functions (TVFs), as well as differences between [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] and common language runtime (CLR) TVFs.  
  
 [CLR User-Defined Aggregates](clr-user-defined-aggregates.md)  
 Describes how to implement and use user-defined aggregates.
