# SqlServerAlias Class
  The [SqlServerAlias Class](sqlserveralias-class.md) class represents a server connection alias.  
  
 A server connection alias is required when both the following occur:  
  
-   The client is connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] over a network transport that is not the default network transport.  
  
-   The instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to which the client is connected listens on an alternate named pipe.  
  
 **Note:** The [SqlServerAlias Class](sqlserveralias-class.md) inherits the `Put` method from the Provider class. However, it does not return any results as indicated by the `Provider::Put` method. For more information, see the WMI documentation.
