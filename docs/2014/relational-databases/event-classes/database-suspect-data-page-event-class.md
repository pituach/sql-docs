# Database Suspect Data Page Event Class
  The **Database Suspect Data Page** event class indicates when a page is added to the [suspect_pages](/sql/relational-databases/system-tables/suspect-pages-transact-sql) table in [msdb](../databases/msdb-database.md). Include this event class in traces that are monitoring the occurrence of suspect pages.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This event is issued asynchronously from the insertion of a corresponding row into the **suspect_pages** table. Therefore, a job listening on this event might not find the corresponding **suspect_pages** entry immediately.  
  
 When the **Database Suspect Data Page** event class is included in a trace the relative overhead is low. The overhead might be greater if the number of suspect pages increases, for example, if a disk drive is experiencing problems.
