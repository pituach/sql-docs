# Lesson 1: Converting a Table to a Hierarchical Structure
  Customers who have tables using self joins to express hierarchical relationships can convert their tables to a hierarchical structure using this lesson as a guide. It is relatively easy to migrate from this representation to one using `hierarchyid`. After migration, users will have a compact and easy to understand hierarchical representation, which can be indexed in several ways for efficient queries.  
  
 This lesson, examines an existing table, creates a new table containing a `hierarchyid` column, populates the table with the data from the source table, and then demonstrates three indexing strategies. This lesson contains the following topics:  
  
-   [Examining the Current Structure of the Employee Table](lesson-1-1-examining-the-current-structure-of-the-employee-table.md)  
  
-   [Populating a Table with Existing Hierarchical Data](lesson-1-2-populating-a-table-with-existing-hierarchical-data.md)  
  
-   [Optimizing the NewOrg Table](lesson-1-3-optimizing-the-neworg-table.md)  
  
-   [Summary: Converting a Table to a Hierarchical Structure](lesson-1-4-summary-converting-a-table-to-a-hierarchical-structure.md)
