# SQL Server, Backup Device Object
  The **Backup Device** object provides counters to monitor Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] backup devices used for backup and restore operations. Monitor backup devices when you want to determine the throughput or the progress and performance of your backup and restore operations on a per device basis. To monitor the throughput of the entire database backup or restore operation, use the **Backup/Restore Throughput/sec** counter of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] **Databases** object. For more information, see [SQL Server, Databases Object](sql-server-databases-object.md).  
  
 This table describes the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] **Backup Device** counter.  
  
|SQL Server Backup Device counters|Description|  
|---------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**Device Throughput Bytes/sec**|Throughput of read and write operations (in bytes per second) for a backup device used when backing up or restoring databases. This counter exists only while the backup or restore operation is executing.|
