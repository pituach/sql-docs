# Monitor and Enforce Best Practices by Using Policy-Based Management
  Policy-Based Management allows you monitor best practices for the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides a set of policy files that you can import as best practice policies, and then evaluate the policies against a target set that includes instances, instance objects, databases, or database objects. You can evaluate policies manually, set policies to evaluate a target set according to a schedule, or set policies to evaluate a target set according to an event. For more information about Policy-Based Management, see [Administer Servers by Using Policy-Based Management](administer-servers-by-using-policy-based-management.md).  
  
## Policy and Rules for Database Engine  
 The following table lists the policies that are included with the installation of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and includes information about the best practices rules that each policy evaluates. The policies are stored as XML files and must be imported into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information about how to import policies, see [Import a Policy-Based Management Policy](import-a-policy-based-management-policy.md).
