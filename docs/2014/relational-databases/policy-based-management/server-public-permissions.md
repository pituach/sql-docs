# Server public Permissions
  This rule determines whether the public server role has server permissions. Every login that is created on the server is a member of the public server role. If this condition is met, every login on the server will have server permissions.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 Do not grant server permissions to the server public role.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  After setup completes the **PUBLIC** role has `CONNECT` permission on all the endpoints except the **Dedicated Admin Connection**. This is normal and should not be normally changed. (Access is controlled by using the `CONNECT SQL` permission which is automatically granted when new logins are created.)
