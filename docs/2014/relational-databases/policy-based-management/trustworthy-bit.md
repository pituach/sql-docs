# Trustworthy Bit
  This rule determines whether the dbo role for a database is assigned to the sysadmin fixed server role and the database has its trustworthy bit set to ON.  
  
 If these conditions are met, a privileged database user can elevate privileges to the sysadmin role. In this role, the user can create and run unsafe assemblies that compromise the system.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 Turn off the trustworthy bit or revoke sysadmin permissions from the dbo database role.  
  
## For More Information  
 [ALTER DATABASE &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql)
