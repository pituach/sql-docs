# Tutorial: Administering Servers by Using Policy-Based Management
  Welcome to the Administering Servers by Using Policy-Based Management Policies tutorial. This tutorial is intended for users who are familiar with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] but new to the Policy-Based Management.  
  
## What You Will Learn  
 This tutorial creates a policy to administer your server and a policy that applies to a single database. One policy is run on demand to test for compliance. The other policy enforces future compliance.  
  
 This tutorial is divided into two lessons:  
  
 [Lesson 1: Create and Apply an Off By Default Policy](lesson-1-create-and-apply-an-off-by-default-policy.md)  
 This lesson creates a policy that specifies that Database Mail is not enabled on the server. Then, it checks to see whether your server complies with the policy, and configures the server by disabling Database Mail.  
  
 [Lesson 2: Create and Apply a Naming Standards Policy](lesson-2-create-and-apply-a-naming-standards-policy.md)  
 This lesson creates a policy that defines and enforces a naming standard for tables.  
  
## Requirements  
 This lesson requires basic database knowledge and a basic understanding of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 To use this tutorial, your system must have [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] installed.
