# Client-side and Server-side Formatting (SQLXML 4.0)
  SQLXML provides two ways to format an XML document:  
  
-   Server-side formatting  
  
-   Client-side formatting  
  
 This section includes information about formatting XML documents on either the client side or the server side from the rowsets that are generated by queries executed against a database in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
