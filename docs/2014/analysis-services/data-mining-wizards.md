# Data Mining Wizards
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] provides wizards for use in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 The following table describes the wizards that you can use to create data mining sources, views, and objects.  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Data Source Wizard F1 Help &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](data-source-wizard-f1-help-analysis-services.md)|Use the Data Source Wizard to define a new data source.|  
|[Data Source View Wizard F1 Help &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](data-source-view-wizard-f1-help-analysis-services.md)|Use the Data Source View Wizard to define a new data source view.|  
|[Data Mining Wizard F1 Help &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](data-mining-wizard-f1-help-analysis-services-data-mining.md)|Use the Data Mining Wizard to define a new mining structure and associated mining models.|  
  
 In addition to the wizards, you can build, modify, and process data mining objects in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] by using the graphical design tools that are provided.  
  
 For more information about editors that help you build data mining projects, see [Data Mining Designers and Dialog Boxes](data-mining-designers-and-dialog-boxes.md).  
  
 For information about wizards that help you design and work with multidimensional data, see [Analysis Services Wizards &#40;Multidimensional Data&#41;](analysis-services-wizards-multidimensional-data.md).
