# Relabel (SQL Server Data Mining Add-ins)
  ![Office 13 icon for Relabel tool](media/dm13-relabel.gif "Office 13 icon for Relabel tool")  
  
 The Data Mining Client for Excel helps you create new labels for data to make it easier to understand the results of analysis.  
  
 Reasons for relabeling include:  
  
-   The data includes results that were coded, such as 1 for Male and 2 for Female.  
  
-   You are bucketing numeric values and want to give the ranges a descriptive name.  
  
-   You want to simplify long names.  
  
## Using the Relabel Wizard  
  
1.  In the **Data Mining** ribbon, click **Clean** and then select **Re-Label**.  
  
2.  Select the table or data range that has the data you want to fix.  
  
3.  In the **Re-label** page of the wizard, select a single column, either by choosing the column from the dropdown list, or by clicking the column in the **Data samples** pane.  
  
     The **Data samples** pane only shows about 50 rows of data, but they are sampled to ensure that you see a good spread of values.  
  
     Click the column header for **Count** to sort by the count of each value.  
  
     You can also sort by **Original Labels**, which is handy if you want to re-label all the highest or lowest values first.  
  
4.  In the **Re-label** data page of the wizard, review the values in the **Original Labels** column, and decide how you want to group or edit them.  
  
5.  Type a new value into the row under **New Labels**. You can also choose a value from the list of existing values. As you type new values, they become available for re-use right away.  
  
6.  When you have entered enough rows, click **Next**, and on the **Select Destination** page, choose where youâ€™ll save the relabeled data.  
  
    -   **Add as a new column to the current worksheet**  
  
         Click to add a new column to the table that contains the new values.  
  
    -   **Copy sheet data with changes to a new worksheet**  
  
         Click to create a new worksheet that contains the updated data.  
  
    -   **Change data in place**  
  
         Click to replace the original data with the new values.
