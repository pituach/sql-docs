# Set Dimension Intelligence Options (Business Intelligence Wizard)
  Use the **Set Dimension Intelligence Options** page to select the dimension to which the Business Intelligence Wizard will apply dimension intelligence. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] supports several standard business types for dimensions and attributes, such as product dimensions or account dimensions. Client applications can use these business types to provide additional analysis support for business intelligence solutions. For more information about available dimension types and attribute types, see [Dimension Types](multidimensional-models-olap-logical-dimension-objects/database-dimension-properties-types.md) and [Attributes and Attribute Hierarchies](multidimensional-models-olap-logical-dimension-objects/attributes-and-attribute-hierarchies.md).
