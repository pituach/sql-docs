# Data Source View Wizard F1 Help (Analysis Services)
  Use the Data Source View Wizard to create a data source view for use in the following business intelligence projects in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Project  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] Project  
  
-   Report Model Project  
  
 Depending on the database structure, the Data Source View Wizard guides you through some or all the following steps:  
  
-   Specifying the underlying data source.  
  
-   Setting naming conventions to help in identifying relationships.  
  
-   Selecting tables and views for the data source view.  
  
-   Naming and saving the data source view.  
  
 After you create a data source view, you can use Data Source View Designer to change the view's properties in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)].
