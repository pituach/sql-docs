# Technical Reference (Data Mining Add-ins for Excel)
  The Data Mining Add-Ins for Office have features useful to programmers and advanced data miners.  
  
 **Data mining templates**  
  
 The add-ins include a set of templates to help you quickly create custom models or prediction queries using DMX. Even if you already know some DMX, the templates can make it much faster and easier to build complex statements without error, from inside Excel.  
  
-   [DMX Templates](dmx-templates.md)  
  
 **Data mining algorithms and algorithm parameters**  
  
 If you use the wizards in the Data Mining Client for Excel, you can change algorithm parameters and set advanced options to customize the way that the algorithm processes data.

 **Configuration wizard help**  
  
 The configuration wizard runs the first time that you open the add-ins, to help you connect to an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] server. If you have trouble with any of the steps, see this topic for additional help.
