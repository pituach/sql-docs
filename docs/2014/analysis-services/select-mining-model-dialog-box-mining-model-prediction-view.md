# Select Mining Model Dialog Box (Mining Model Prediction View)
  Use the **Select Mining Model** dialog box to select a mining model on which to base your predictions.  
  
 The dialog box contains a tree view list of each mining structure that exists on the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database, and all the associated mining models. You can expand each mining structure to select the appropriate mining model.
