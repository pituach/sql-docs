# Importing (SSAS)
  This page of the **Table Import Wizard** enables you to view the progress of the import operation. To access the wizard from the [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)], on the **Model** menu, click **Import from Data Source**.  
  
## UIElement List  
 **Details**  
 Displays the following information for each data import operation.  
  
|Column|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|**Work Item**|Displays the name of the table or view that is being imported.|  
|**Status**|Indicates whether the table or view was successfully imported and the number of rows that were imported.|  
|**Message**|If the table or view import failed, displays a link to more information. This information is displayed in the Details window.<br /><br /> To try again to import the table or view, exit the wizard and run it again.|
