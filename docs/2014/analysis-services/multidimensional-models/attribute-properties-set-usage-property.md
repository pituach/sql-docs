# Set Usage Property
  You can set the usage for an attribute by using the **Dimension Structure** view in Dimension Designer, which is accessed from [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 When you set usage for an attribute, your changes do not take effect until you process the dimension. For more information, see [Multidimensional Model Object Processing](processing-a-multidimensional-model-analysis-services.md).  
  
### To set usage for an attribute  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click a dimension, and click **Open**.  
  
     The **Dimension Structure** view opens by default.  
  
2.  In **Attributes**, right-click the attribute for which you which you want to set usage, point to **Set Attribute Usage**, and then click one of the following options:  
  
    -   **Regular**  
  
    -   **Key**  
  
    -   **Parent**
