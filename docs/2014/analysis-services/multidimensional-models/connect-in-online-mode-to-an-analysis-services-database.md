# Connect in Online Mode to an Analysis Services Database
  You can connect directly to an existing [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database and directly modify objects within that database. When you connect directly to an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database, changes to objects occur immediately and no [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project is created within [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
### To Connect Directly to an Analysis Services Database by using SQL Server Data Tools  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **Open** and then click **Analysis Services Database**.  
  
3.  Select **Connect to existing database**.  
  
4.  Specify the server name and the database name.  
  
     You can either type the database name or query the server to view the existing databases on the server.  
  
5.  Click **OK**.  
  
     You can now directly edit any objects within the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database.
