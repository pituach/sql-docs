# Document and Script an Analysis Services Database
  After an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database is deployed, you can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to output the metadata of the database, or of an object contained in the database, as an XML for Analysis (XMLA) script. You can output this script to a new **XMLA Query Editor** window, to a file, or to the Clipboard. For more information about XMLA, see [Analysis Services Scripting Language &#40;ASSL&#41; Reference](../scripting/analysis-services-scripting-language-assl-for-xmla.md).  
  
 The generated XMLA script uses [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Scripting Language (ASSL) elements to define the objects contained by the script. If you generated a CREATE script, the resulting XMLA script contains an XMLA **Create** command and ASSL elements that can be used to create the entire [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database structure on an instance. If you generated an ALTER script, the resulting XMLA script contains an XMLA **Alter** command and ASSL elements that can be used to restore the structure of an existing [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database to the state of the database at the time the script was created.  
  
 You can use the generated XMLA script from an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database in many ways, including:  
  
-   To maintain a backup script that allows you to recreate all the database objects and permissions.  
  
-   To create or update database development code.  
  
-   To create a test or development environment from an existing schema.
