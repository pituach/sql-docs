# PowerPivot Data Refresh
  After you create a workbook that contains PowerPivot data, you might want to periodically refresh the data by rerunning a query or command to get updated information from the sources you used originally to create the workbook. This process is called `data refresh`, and you can refresh data on demand in [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiClient](../../includes/ssgeminiclient-md.md)], or as a scheduled operation that runs as an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] process on an application server in a SharePoint farm. For more information, see:

> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and SharePoint Server 2013 Excel Services use a different architecture for data refresh of PowerPivot data models. The SharePoint 2013 supported architecture utilizes Excel Services as the primary component to load PowerPivot data models. The previous data refresh architecture used relied on a server running PowerPivot System Service and [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] in SharePoint mode to load data models.
