# Could not load file or assembly &#39;Microsoft.Data.Services, Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089&#39; or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
  In SharePoint 2010 environments that have PowerPivot for SharePoint, this error will occur if you attempt a data feed export and the system is missing the required version of Microsoft ADO.NET Data Services.

## Explanation  
 SharePoint 2010 includes an Export as Data Feed button that you can use to export a SharePoint list as an XML data feed. In addition, both Reporting Services in SharePoint mode and PowerPivot for SharePoint support data feed features that require ADO.NET Data Services.  
  
 If ADO.NET Data Services is not installed, this error will occur when you request a data feed.  
  
## User Action  
  
1.  Go to the hardware and software requirements documentation for SharePoint 2010, [Determine Hardware and Software Requirements (SharePoint 2010)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=169734) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=169734).  
  
2.  In **Installing software prerequisites**, find the link for ADO.NET Data Services 3.5 that corresponds to the operating system you are using.  
  
3.  Click the link and run the setup program that installs the service.
