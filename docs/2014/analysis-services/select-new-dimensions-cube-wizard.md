# Select New Dimensions (Cube Wizard)
  Use the **Select New Dimensions** page to select the new dimensions to create.  
  
## Options  
 **Dimensions**  
 Select the dimensions to create. By default, all dimensions are selected.  
  
 The root nodes of the tree represent the new dimensions that will be created. The related tables that will be used to create the dimension are displayed under the dimension node.  
  
 To rename a dimension, click the dimension name and enter a new name. You cannot rename the tables.
