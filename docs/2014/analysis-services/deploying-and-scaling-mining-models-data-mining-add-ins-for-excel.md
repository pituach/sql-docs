# Deploying and Scaling Mining Models (Data Mining Add-ins for Excel)
  The tools in the **Model Usage** and **Management** group are provided to help you manage and browse existing mining models. You can use these tools to view any models that are stored on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], not just those created using the add-ins.  
  
 If you have the necessary permissions, you can delete, modify, rename, or process existing mining models and structures without leaving Excel.  
  
## Model Usage Toolbar  
  
### Browse  
 Use the **Browse** wizard to select an existing data mining model, and then view and explore the model in a viewer that contains multiple graphs and tools.  
  
 For more information, see [Browsing Models in Excel &#40;SQL Server Data Mining Add-ins&#41;](browsing-models-in-excel-sql-server-data-mining-add-ins.md).  
  
### Document Model  
 Click **Document Model** to start a wizard that creates a report of the mining structures and mining models that you have created. You can create basic or advanced reports. The reports include column and model metadata, so are useful for documenting your work and tracking changes in models.  
  
 For more information, see [Documenting Mining Models &#40;Data Mining Add-ins for Excel&#41;](documenting-mining-models-data-mining-add-ins-for-excel.md).  
  
### Query  
 Click **Query** to start the **Query** wizard. The wizard interactively walks you through the process of creating a prediction query against an existing data mining model.  
  
 To further customize the query, or build queries not included in the wizard, just click the **Advanced** button to start the **Data Mining Query Advanced Editor**.  
  
 For more information, see [Query &#40;SQL Server Data Mining Add-ins&#41;](query-sql-server-data-mining-add-ins.md).  
  
### Data Mining Advanced Query Editor  
 In this editor, you can use Data Mining Extensions (DMX) templates to jumpstart a query, and then modify the inputs, outputs, algorithms, and parameters to create a custom mining model, mining structure, or prediction query.  
  
 For more information, see [Advanced Data Mining Query Editor](advanced-data-mining-query-editor.md).  
  
## Management  
 Use the **Manage Models** wizard to view existing models on the current connection. You can also delete, rename, process, or import and export mining models and structures.  
  
 For more information, see [Manage Models &#40;SQL Server Data Mining Add-ins&#41;](manage-models-sql-server-data-mining-add-ins.md).
