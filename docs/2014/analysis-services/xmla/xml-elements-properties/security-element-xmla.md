# Security Element (XMLA)
  Specifies how to back up or restore security definitions, such as roles and permissions, during a [Backup](../xml-elements-commands/backup-element-xmla.md) or [Restore](../xml-elements-commands/restore-element-xmla.md) command.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
  
<Backup> <!-- or Restore -->  
   ...  
   <Security>...</Security>  
   ...  
</Backup>  
```

## Remarks  
 The `Security` element determines whether the security definitions, such as roles and permissions, defined on a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database are backed up or restored during, respectively, a `Backup` or `Restore` command. This element also determines if the Windows user accounts and groups defined as members of the security definitions are included as part of the `Backup` or `Restore` command.  
  
 The value of this element is limited to one of the strings listed in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|*SkipMembership*|Include security definitions, but exclude membership information, during `Backup` or `Restore` commands.|  
|*CopyAll*|Include security definitions and membership information during `Backup` or `Restore` commands.|  
|*IgnoreSecurity*|Exclude security definitions during `Backup` or `Restore` commands.|
