 Describes the CSDL extensions that define a tabular model in XML syntax. It also includes information about the tabular object model.  
  
 [Data Mining Programming](dev-guide/data-mining-programming.md)  
 Describes the approaches building solutions that include data mining objects.  
  
 [Multidimensional Model Programming](multidimensional-models/multidimensional-model-programming.md)  
 Describes the development tasks and approaches for integrating multidimensional model objects in a custom solution.  
  
 [Analysis Services Schema Rowsets](schema-rowsets/analysis-services-schema-rowsets.md)  
 Describes the schema rowsets that provide information about server state, server operations, and database objects.  
  
 [Analysis Services Scripting Language &#40;ASSL&#41; Reference](scripting/analysis-services-scripting-language-assl-for-xmla.md)  
 Describes the ASSL extensions to XMLA. ASSL provides a data definition and manipulation language for Analysis Services multidimensional models that supplements the XMLA specification.  
  
 [XML for Analysis  &#40;XMLA&#41; Reference](xmla/xml-for-analysis-xmla-reference.md)
