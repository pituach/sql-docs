# Script Organizer (Calculations Tab, Cube Designer) (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the **Script Organizer** pane on the **Calculations** tab in Cube Designer to access and reorder the calculated members, named sets, and script commands contained in the cube script for the specified cube.  
  
> [!NOTE]

## Options  
 **Step**  
 Displays the execution order of the calculated members, named sets, and script commands within the cube script.  
  
 Click **Move Up** or **Move Down** in the **Toolbar** pane or context menu to change the execution order of the calculations.  
  
 **Type**
