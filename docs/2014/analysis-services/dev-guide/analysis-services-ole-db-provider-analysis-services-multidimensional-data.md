# Analysis Services OLE DB Provider (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  The Analysis Services OLE DB Provider is an interface for applications interacting with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. It is used to build client applications that interact with multidimensional data. This provider also provides methods for online and offline data mining analysis of multidimensional data and relational data, and is included as part of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. It can be redistributed by third-party client applications.  
  
 The Analysis Services OLE DB Provider is the primary method for interacting with [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] in order to accomplish such tasks as connecting to a cube or data mining model, querying a cube or data mining model, and retrieving schema information.  
  
 As a stand-alone provider, the Analysis Services OLE DB Provider provides client applications with the ability to create local cube files and mining models from relational and multidimensional sources. Client applications can connect to a local cube and execute queries using Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) without interacting with the full-scale server running the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)].
