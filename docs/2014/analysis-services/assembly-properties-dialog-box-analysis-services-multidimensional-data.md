  Use the **Assembly Properties** dialog box in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to set the properties of an assembly reference in an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database. You can display the **Assembly Properties** dialog box by right-clicking an assembly in **Object Explorer** and selecting **Properties**.
