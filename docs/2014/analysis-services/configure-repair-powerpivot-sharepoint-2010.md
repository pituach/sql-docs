# Configure or Repair PowerPivot for SharePoint 2010 (PowerPivot Configuration Tool)
  To configure or repair an installation of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] PowerPivot for SharePoint 2010, use the PowerPivot Configuration tool. The configuration tool starts by scanning the system and returns a list of actions needed to complete or repair an installation. The [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] setup wizard installs the PowerPivot Configuration Tool for SharePoint 2010 as well as a PowerPivot Configuration Tool for SharePoint 2013. This topic describes the PowerPivot Configuration Tool for SharePoint 2010. For more information on SharePoint 2010, see [Configure or Repair PowerPivot for SharePoint 2013 &#40;PowerPivot Configuration Tool&#41;](power-pivot-sharepoint/configure-or-repair-power-pivot-for-sharepoint-2013.md).  
  
 **[!INCLUDE[applies](../includes/applies-md.md)]**  SharePoint 2010  
  
 
  
##  <a name="bkmk_before"></a> Before you start  
 The PowerPivot for SharePoint 2010 Configuration Tool scans for program files, registry settings, and available ports. To get the most use out of the tools, review the following.  
  
-   General requirements to run the configuration tool, [PowerPivot Configuration Tools](power-pivot-sharepoint/power-pivot-configuration-tools.md).  
  
-   PowerPivot for SharePoint 2010 requires web applications configured for classic mode authentication. If the PowerPivot for SharePoint 2010 Configuration Tool creates the application for you, the application is configured for classic mode.  
  
-   Port 80 must be available one of the selected tasks requires the Configuration tool to create and configure a web application.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_using"></a> Using the PowerPivot Configuration Tool  
 The first page of the tool provides a summary of the input values used to configure the SharePoint farm. In addition to the input values that you provide, default values are used to configure the system. Default names are used for service applications, service application databases, and service application properties.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  If the PowerPivot Configuration tool scans the computer and returns a blank task list in the left pane, then no features or settings need configuration. To modify the SharePoint or PowerPivot configuration, use Windows PowerShell or the management pages in SharePoint Central Administration. For more information, see [PowerPivot Server Administration and Configuration in Central Administration](power-pivot-sharepoint/power-pivot-server-administration-and-configuration-in-central-administration.md).  
  
 Values for service accounts are used for multiple services. For example, the PowerPivot Configuration tool uses the default account on the first page to set all application pool identities. You can change these accounts later by modifying the service application properties in Central Administration.  
  
-   The exception to this rule in the PowerPivot for SharePoint 2010 Configuration tool is the Analysis Services service account. This account is specified during Setup, and you type a password for this account in the **Register SQL Server Analysis Services (PowerPivot on Local Server)** action. The summary page does not include a field for this password, so be sure to enter it on the page for that action.  
  
 The tool provides a tabbed interface that includes parameter inputs, Windows PowerShell script, and status messages.  
  
 The PowerPivot Configuration tool uses Windows PowerShell to configure the server. You can click the **Script** tab to review the Windows PowerShell script the.  
  
 ![Configuration Tool user interface](media/ssas-pctui.gif "Configuration Tool user interface")  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_steps"></a> Configuration steps  
 The link to the configuration tool is only visible when PowerPivot for SharePoint 2010 is installed on the local server.  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, click [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../includes/sscurrentui-md.md)], click **Configuration Tools**, and then click **PowerPivot Configuration Tool**.  
  
2.  Click **Configure or Repair PowerPivot for SharePoint**.  
  
3.  Expand the window to full size. You should see a button bar at the bottom of the window that includes **Validate**, **Run**, and **Exit** commands.  
  
4.  **Default Account:** On the Parameters tab, type a domain user account for the **Default Account Username**. This account is used to provision essential services, including the PowerPivot service application pool. Do not specify a built-in account such as Network Service or Local System. The tool blocks configurations that specify built-in accounts.  
  
     **Passphrase:** type a passphrase. For a new SharePoint farm, the passphrase is used whenever a new server or application is added to the SharePoint farm. If it is an existing farm, enter the passphrase that allows you to add a server application to the farm.  
  
5.  **Port:** Optionally, type a port number to connect to the Central Administration web application or use the provided randomly generated number. The configuration tool checks that the number is available before offering it as an option.  
  
6.  Click **Register SQL Server Analysis Services (PowerPivot) on Local Server**.  
  
     Enter the password of the Analysis Services service account.  
  
7.  Optionally, review the remaining input values used to complete each action. For more information about each one, see [Input values used to configure the server](#bkmk_input) in this topic.  
  
8.  Optionally, remove any actions that you do not want to process. For example, if you want to configure Secure Store Service later, click **Configure Secure Store Service**, and then clear the checkbox **Include this action in the task list**.  
  
9. Click **Validate** to check whether the tool has sufficient information to process the actions in the list.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you get a farm configuration error, it might be because SharePoint 2010 Server SP1 is not installed.  
  
10. Click **Run** to process all of the actions in the task list. The **Run** button is enabled after you validate the actions. If **Run** is not enabled, click **Validate** first.  
  
11. [Verify a PowerPivot for SharePoint Installation](instances/install-windows/verify-a-power-pivot-for-sharepoint-installation.md).  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_input"></a> Input values used to configure the server  
 The PowerPivot Configuration Tool uses a combination of input values that you type in and default values that it detects or uses automatically.  
  
 The list of actions listed in the configuration tool depends on the SharePoint farms current configuration. For example, if the SharePoint farm is already configured, no actions will be listed in the tool. You can run the tool at any time to configure, repair, or detect configuration errors. If required services such as Excel Services or Secure Store Service are not running in the farm, the tool will detect the missing services and provide options to enable them. If no actions are required, the task list will be empty.  
  
 The following table describes the values that are used to configure the server.

 If the PowerPivot Configuration Tool creates the farm, it creates the required databases on the database server, using the same file naming conventions as SharePoint. You cannot change the farm database name.  
  
 If the tool creates a site collection, it creates a content database on the database server, using the same file naming conventions as SharePoint. You cannot change the content database name.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_nextsteps"></a> Next steps  
 After you complete a server installation, there are several post-installation tasks you should perform:  
  
-   Grant SharePoint permissions to individuals and groups. This task is necessary to enable access to sites and content.  
  
-   Change the service application pool identities to run under a different account. Specifying different identities for services and applications is a SharePoint best practice recommendation for secure deployment.  
  
-   Create additional trusted sites in Excel Services so that you can vary permissions and configuration settings that work best for PowerPivot data access.  
  
-   Install ADO.NET Data Services 3.5 SP1 to enable data feed export from SharePoint lists.  
  
-   Install commonly used data providers to enable server-side data refresh.  
  
-   Download the PowerPivot authoring tool to your workstation computer to create a PowerPivot workbook and then publish it to SharePoint. Installing the tool and publishing a PowerPivot workbook completes the installation cycle by verifying the interoperability of the server components you just installed.  
  
### Grant SharePoint Permissions to Workbook Users  
 Users will need SharePoint permissions before they can publish or view workbooks. Be sure to grant **View** permissions to users who need to view published workbooks and **Contribute** permissions to users who publish or manage workbooks. You must be a site collection administrator to grant permissions.  
  
1.  In the site, click **Site Actions**.  
  
2.  Click **Site Permissions**.  
  
3.  Create groups as needed if you want a set of users with **Contribute** permissions and another group for a set of users with only **View** permissions.  
  
4.  Enter the Windows domain user or group accounts who should have membership in the groups. As before, do not use e-mail addresses or distribution group if the application is configured for classic authentication.  
  
### Install ADO.NET Data Services 3.5 SP1  
 ADO.NET Data Services is required for a data feed export of SharePoint lists. SharePoint 2010 does not include this component in the PrerequisiteInstaller program, so you must install it manually.  
  
1.  Go to the hardware and software requirements documentation for SharePoint 2010, [Determine Hardware and Software Requirements (SharePoint 2010)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=169734)  
  
2.  In Installing software prerequisites, find the link for ADO.NET Data Services 3.5 that corresponds to the operating system you are using.  
  
3.  Click the link and run the setup program that installs the service.  
  
### Install Data Providers Used in Data Refresh and Check User Permissions  
 Server-side data refresh allows users to re-import updated data to their workbooks in unattended mode. In order for data refresh to succeed, the server must have the same data provider that was used to originally import the data. In addition, the user account under which data refresh runs often requires read permissions on the external data sources. Be sure to check the requirements for enabling and configuring data refresh to ensure a successful outcome. For more information, see [PowerPivot Data Refresh with SharePoint 2010](powerpivot-data-refresh-with-sharepoint-2010.md).  
  
### Change Application Pool and Service Identities in SharePoint  
 The PowerPivot Configuration tool provisions farm features, applications, and services to run under a single account. This simplifies installation, but it does not result in a deployment that meets the security requirements of a SharePoint farm. To create a more robust deployment, change the application pools and service identities to run under different accounts after setup is complete. For more information, see [Configure PowerPivot Service Accounts](power-pivot-sharepoint/configure-power-pivot-service-accounts.md).  
  
### Create Additional Trusted Sites in Excel Services  
 You can add trusted sites in Excel Services to vary permissions and configuration settings on sites that provide Excel workbooks and PowerPivot data. For more information, see [Create a trusted location for PowerPivot sites in Central Administration](power-pivot-sharepoint/create-a-trusted-location-for-power-pivot-sites-in-central-administration.md).  
  
### Add Servers or Applications  
 Over time, if you determine that additional data storage and processing capability is needed, you can add a second PowerPivot for SharePoint server instance to the farm. For instructions, see [Deployment Checklist: Scale-out by adding PowerPivot Servers to a SharePoint 2010 farm](../../2014/sql-server/install/deployment-checklist-scale-out-adding-powerpivot-servers-sharepoint-2010-farm.md).
