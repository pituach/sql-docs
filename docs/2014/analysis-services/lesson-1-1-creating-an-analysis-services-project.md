# Creating an Analysis Services Project
  In the following task, you use [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to create a new [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project named `Analysis Services Tutorial`, based on the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Project template. A *project* is a collection of related objects. Projects exist within a solution, which includes one or more projects. For more information, see [Create an Analysis Services Project &#40;SSDT&#41;](multidimensional-models/create-an-analysis-services-project-ssdt.md).  
  
### To create a new Analysis Services project  
  
1.  Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2012**, and then click **SQL Server Data Tools**.  
  
     The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] development environment opens.  
  
2.  On the Start page of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], click **New Project**.  
  
3.  In the **New Project** dialog box, in the **Installed Templates** pane, expand **Business Intelligence**, and then select **Analysis Services**. Choose the **Analysis Services Multidimensional and Data Mining Project** template.  
  
     Notice the default project name, location, and the default solution name are generated in the bottom of the dialog box. By default, a new directory is created for the solution.  
  
4.  Change the project Name to `Analysis Services Tutorial`, which also changes the **Solution name** box, and then click **OK**.  
  
 You have successfully created the `Analysis Services Tutorial` project, based on the **Analysis Services Multidimensional and Data Mining Project** template, within a new solution that is also named `Analysis Services Tutorial`.
