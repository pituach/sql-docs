# Grid (Dimension Usage Tab, Cube Designer) (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the **Grid** pane on the **Dimension Usage** tab in Cube Designer to view and edit dimension relationships between cube dimensions and measure groups. Each dimension relationship is represented as a cell in a grid, in which measure groups are displayed as columns and dimensions are displayed as rows.  
  
## Options  
  
|Option|Definition|  
|------------|----------------|  
|**Measure Groups**|Select the measure groups to display in the **Grid** pane as columns. Selecting **(Show All)** displays all of the available measure groups.<br /><br /> Click a selected column header for a measure group to rename the measure group.|  
|**Dimensions**|Select the cube dimensions to display in the **Grid** pane as rows. Selecting **(Show All)** displays all of the available cube dimensions.<br /><br /> Click a selected row header for a dimension to rename the cube dimension.|  
|**(Cell)**|Select a cell and click the ellipsis button (**...**) to display the **Define Relationship** dialog box and define a dimension relationship between a cube dimension and a measure group. For more information about the **Define Relationship** dialog box, see [Define Relationship Dialog Box &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](define-relationship-dialog-box-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|  
  
## Context Menu  
 The following options are available in the context menu, which is displayed by right-clicking the **Grid** pane:  
  
|Option|Definition|  
|------------|----------------|  
|**Add Cube Dimension**|Select to display the **Add Cube Dimension** dialog box and add references to existing or new database dimensions in the cube. For more information about the **Add Cube Dimension** dialog box, see [Add Cube Dimension Dialog Box &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](add-cube-dimension-dialog-box-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|  
|**New Linked Object**|Select to display the **Linked Object Wizard** and link measure groups and dimensions from other cubes, and to import actions, KPIs, and calculations, to the selected cube. For more information about the **Linked Object Wizard**, see [Linked Object Wizard F1 Help](linked-object-wizard-f1-help.md).|  
|**Cut**|Note: This option is disabled.|  
|**Copy**|Note: This option is disabled.|  
|**Paste**|Note: This option is disabled.|  
|**Delete**|Select to delete the selected cube dimension, measure group, or dimension relationship from the cube.|  
|**Rename**|Select to rename the selected cube dimension, measure group, or dimension relationship.|  
|**Properties**|Select to display the **Properties** window in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] for the selected cube dimension, measure group, or dimension relationship.|
