# Data Sources Supported (SSAS Tabular)
  This topic describes the types of data sources that can be used with tabular models.  
  
 This article contains the following sections:  
  
-   [Supported Data Sources](#bkmk_supported_ds)  
  
-   [Unsupported Sources](#bkmk_unsupported_ds)  
  
-   [Tips for Choosing Data Sources](#bkmk_tips)  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_supported_ds"></a> Supported Data Sources  
 You can import data from the data sources in the following table. When you install [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], setup does not install the providers that are listed for each data source. Some providers might already be installed with other applications on your computer; in other cases you will need to download and install the provider.

 <sup>1</sup> You can also use the OLE DB Provider for ODBC.  
  
 <sup>2</sup> For more information about SQL Azure, see the web site [SQL Azure](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=157856).  
  
 <sup>3</sup> For more information about SQL Server PDW, see the web site [SQL Server 2008 R2 Parallel Data Warehouse](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150895).  
  
 <sup>4</sup> In some cases, using the MSDAORA OLE DB provider can result in connection errors, particularly with newer versions of Oracle. If you encounter any errors, we recommend that you use one of the other providers listed for Oracle.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_unsupported_ds"></a> Unsupported Sources  
 The following data source is not currently supported:  
  
-   Server documents such as Access databases already published to SharePoint, cannot be imported.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_tips"></a> Tips for Choosing Data Sources  
  
1.  Importing tables from relational databases saves you steps because *foreign key* relationships are used during import to create relationships between tables in the model designer.  
  
2.  Importing multiple tables, and then deleting the ones you don't need, can also save you steps. If you import tables one at a time, you might still need to create relationships between the tables manually.  
  
3.  Columns that contain similar data in different data sources are the basis of creating relationships within the model designer. When using heterogeneous data sources, choose tables that have columns that can be mapped to tables in other data sources that contain identical or similar data.  
  
4.  OLE DB providers can sometimes offer faster performance for large scale data. When choosing between different providers for the same data source, you should try the OLE DB provider first.
