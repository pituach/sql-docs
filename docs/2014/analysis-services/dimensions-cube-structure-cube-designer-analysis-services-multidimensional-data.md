# Dimensions (Cube Structure Tab, Cube Designer) (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the **Dimensions** pane to view and edit cube dimensions, including hierarchies and attributes, on the **Cube Structure** tab in Cube Designer.  
  
## Options  
 **Hierarchies**  
 Click to display the available cube dimensions and their associated cube hierarchies.  
  
 Expand a cube dimension and select **Edit \<dimension>** to display Dimension Designer and edit the database dimension on which the cube dimension is based. For more information about Dimension Designer, see [Dimension Designer &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](dimension-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).  
  
 **Attributes**  
 Click to display the available cube dimensions and their associated cube attributes.  
  
 Expand a cube dimension and select **Edit \<dimension>** to display Dimension Designer and edit the database dimension on which the cube dimension is based. For more information about Dimension Designer, see [Dimension Designer &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](dimension-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).  
  
## Context Menu  
 The following options are available in the context menu displayed by right-clicking the **Dimensions** pane:  
  
 **Add Cube Dimension**  
 Click to display the **Add Cube Dimension** dialog box and add references to existing or new database dimensions in the cube. For more information about the **Add Cube Dimension** dialog box, see [Add Cube Dimension Dialog Box &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](add-cube-dimension-dialog-box-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is displayed only if a dimension is selected.  
  
 **Edit Dimension**  
 Click to display Dimension Designer and edit the database dimension on which the cube dimension is based. For more information about Dimension Designer, see [Dimension Designer &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](dimension-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).  
  
 **Rename**  
 Click to rename the selected cube dimension for the cube.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Renaming a cube dimension in the **Dimensions** pane does not rename the database dimension on which the cube dimension is based.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is displayed only if a dimension is selected.  
  
 **Delete**  
 Click to remove the selected cube dimension from the cube.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Removing a cube dimension from the **Dimensions** pane does not delete the database dimension on which the cube dimension is based.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is displayed only if a dimension is selected.  
  
 **Move Up**  
 Click to move the selected cube database up one place.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is displayed only if a dimension is selected.  
  
 **Move Down**  
 Click to move the selected cube database attribute down one place.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is displayed only if a dimension is selected.  
  
 **New Linked Object**  
 Click to display the **Linked Object Wizard** and link measure groups and dimensions from other cubes, and to import actions, KPIs, and calculations, to the selected cube. For more information about the **Linked Object Wizard**, see [Linked Object Wizard F1 Help](linked-object-wizard-f1-help.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is displayed only if a dimension is selected.  
  
 **Properties**  
 Click to display the **Properties** window of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] for the selected cube dimension, cube hierarchy, or cube attribute.
