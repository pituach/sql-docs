# Considerations for Replaying Traces (SQL Server Profiler)
  [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] cannot replay the following kinds of traces:  
  
-   Traces that contain transactional replication and other transaction log activity. These events are skipped. Other types of replication do not mark the transaction log so they are not affected.  
  
-   Traces that contain operations that involve globally unique identifiers (GUID). These events will be skipped.  
  
-   Traces that contain operations on **text**, **ntext**, and **image** columns involving the **bcp** utility, the BULK INSERT, READTEXT, WRITETEXT, and UPDATETEXT statements, and full-text operations. These events are skipped.  
  
-   Traces that contain session binding: **sp_getbindtoken** and **sp_bindsession** system stored procedures. These events are skipped.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you do not use the preconfigured replay template (**TSQL_Replay**), and do not capture all required data, [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] does not replay the trace. For more information, see [Replay Requirements](replay-requirements.md).  
  
 For information about what permissions are required to replay a trace, see [Permissions Required to Run SQL Server Profiler](sql-server-profiler.md).
