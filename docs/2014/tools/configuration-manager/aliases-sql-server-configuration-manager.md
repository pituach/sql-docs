# Aliases (SQL Server Configuration Manager)
  An alias is an alternate name that can be used to make a connection. The alias encapsulates the required elements of a connection string, and exposes them with a name chosen by the user. To create an alias for the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] clients on this computer, right-click **Aliases** in the console pane, and then click **New Alias**. To configure an existing alias for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] clients on this computer, click **Aliases** in the console pane, right-click the desired existing alias in the details pane, and then click **Properties**.
