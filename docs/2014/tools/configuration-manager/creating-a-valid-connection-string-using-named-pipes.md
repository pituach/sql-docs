# Creating a Valid Connection String Using Named Pipes
  Unless changed by the user, when the default instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] listens on the named pipes protocol, it uses `\\.\pipe\sql\query` as the pipe name. The period indicates that the computer is the local computer, `pipe` indicates that the connection is a named pipe, and `sql\query` is the name of the pipe. To connect to the default pipe, the alias must have `\\<computer_name>\pipe\sql\query` as the pipe name. If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has been configured to listen on a different pipe, the pipe name must use that pipe. For instance, if [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is using `\\.\pipe\unit\app` as the pipe, the alias must use `\\<computer_name>\pipe\unit\app` as the pipe name.  
  
 To create a valid pipe name, you must:  
  
-   Specify an **Alias Name**.  
  
-   Select **Named Pipes** as the **Protocol**.  
  
-   Enter the **Pipe Name**. Alternatively, you can leave **Pipe Name** blank and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager will complete the appropriate pipe name after you specify the **Protocol** and **Server**  
  
-   Specify a **Server**. For a named instance you can provide a server name and instance name.  
  
 At the time of connection, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client component reads the server, protocol, and pipe name values from the registry for the specified alias name, and creates a pipe name in the format `np:\\<computer_name>\pipe\<pipename>` or `np:\\<IPAddress>\pipe\<pipename>`.For a named instance, the default pipe name is `\\<computer_name>\pipe\MSSQL$<instance_name>\sql\query`.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Firewall closes port 445 by default. Because [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] communicates over port 445, you must reopen the port if [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is configured to listen for incoming client connections using named pipes. For information on configuring a firewall, see "How to: Configure a Firewall for SQL Server Access" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online or review your firewall documentation.  
  
## Connecting to the Local Server  
 When connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] running on the same computer as the client, you can use `(local)`as the server name. Using `(local)` is not encouraged because it leads to ambiguity; however it can be useful when the client is known to be running on the intended computer. For instance, when creating an application for mobile disconnected users, such as a sales force, where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will run on laptop computers and store project data, a client connecting to (local) would always connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] running on the laptop. The word `localhost` or a period (.) can be used in place of `(local)`.  
  
## Verifying Your Connection Protocol  
 The following query will return the protocol used for the current connection.  
  
```  
SELECT net_transport   
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections   
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;  
  
```  
  
## Examples  
 Connecting by server name to the default pipe:  
  
```  
Alias Name         <serveralias>  
Pipe Name          <blank>  
Protocol           Named Pipes  
Server             <servername>  
  
```  
  
 Connecting by IP Address to the default pipe:  
  
```  
Alias Name         <serveralias>  
Pipe Name          <leave blank>  
Protocol           Named Pipes  
Server             <IPAddress>  
  
```  
  
 Connecting by server name to a non-default pipe:  
  
```  
Alias Name         <serveralias>  
Pipe Name          \\<servername>\pipe\unit\app  
Protocol           Named Pipes  
Server             <servername>  
  
```  
  
 Connecting by server name to a named instance:  
  
```  
Alias Name         <serveralias>  
Pipe Name          \\<servername>\pipe\MSSQL$<instancename>\SQL\query  
Protocol           Named Pipes  
Server             <servername>  
  
```  
  
 Connecting to the local computer using `localhost`:  
  
```  
Alias Name         <serveralias>  
Pipe Name          <blank>  
Protocol           Named Pipes  
Server             localhost  
  
```  
  
 Connecting to the local computer using a period:  
  
```  
Alias Name         <serveralias>  
Pipe Name          <left blank>  
Protocol           Named Pipes  
Server             .  
  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To specify the network protocol as a **sqlcmd** parameter, see "How to: Connect to the Database Engine Using sqlcmd.exe" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.
