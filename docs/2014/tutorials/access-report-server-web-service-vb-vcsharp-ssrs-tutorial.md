# Accessing the Report Server Web Service Using Visual Basic or Visual C# (SSRS Tutorial)
  The following tutorial shows you how to access the Report Server Web service from an application created with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../includes/csprcs-md.md)].  
  
## What You Will Learn  
 During the course of this tutorial, you will complete the following:  
  
-   Create a client application using the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_long](../includes/vs-dev10-long-md.md)] Console Application project template.  
  
-   Add a Web reference for the Report Server Web service.  
  
-   Write code to access the Web service.  
  
-   Run the console application in debug mode.  
  
## Requirements  
 To complete the tutorial, you must have the following:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../includes/sssql11-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_long](../includes/vs-dev10-long-md.md)] or a similar [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]-compatible development tool.  
  
-   Sufficient permissions to be able to access the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Report Server Web service on the computer where your report server is located.  
  
-   A report installed on your report server. This tutorial uses the sample report, Company Sales. For more information about sample reports, see [SQL Server Reporting Services Product Samples](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=177889).
