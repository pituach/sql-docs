  Query Editor is a significant step towards a more sophisticated authoring environment in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] development. You can easily switch the Query Editor to full-screen mode to view your code or quickly switch your connection to another server. A good place to look for additional features is in the **Options** dialog box, available from the **Tools** menu.
