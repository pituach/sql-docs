# Tutorials for SQL Server 2014
  [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] introduces many new technologies and features.  
  
 There are plans to provide additional tutorials in the future. Meanwhile, you can continue to learn from the [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] tutorials. In some cases, you might find minor differences between the user interface in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] and there might be subtle differences in tutorial prerequisites. If a tutorial uses one of the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoShort](../includes/sssampledbcoshort-md.md)] databases, you should download and use the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] version.  
  
 If you are using a [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] server, you have the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] data providers installed. In order for the tutorials to work, you will either need the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] sample databases that work with those providers, or you need the [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] data providers that work with the [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] version of the sample databases.  
  
-   To download [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] samples to use with tutorials, go to [Samples for SQL Server](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/3735.sql-server-samples-readme.aspx#About_Crescent_Sample_Images) on CodePlex.  
  
-   To download a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbook and [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] reports to use with [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] tutorials, go to [Image Files for HelloWorldPicnic Sample Model in PowerPivot and Power View](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=26719).  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] is a feature of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Add-in for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[SPS2010](../includes/sps2010-md.md)] Enterprise Edition.
