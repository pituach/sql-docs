# Copy Items in a Solution
  You can copy items using Solution Explorer or Windows Explorer.  
  
### To copy items within Solution Explorer  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select the item you want to copy.  
  
2.  On the **Edit** menu, click **Copy**.  
  
3.  In Solution Explorer, select the destination project.  
  
4.  On the **Edit** menu, click **Paste**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Connections cannot be copied between projects. When copying a query with an associated connection to another project, its associated connection is not copied to the target project. You must manually create the connection in the target project.
