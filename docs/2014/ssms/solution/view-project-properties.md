# View Project Properties
  You can view properties associated with your projects in the Properties window.  
  
### To view project properties  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select a project.  
  
2.  If the Properties window is not open, on the **View** menu, click **Properties Window**.  
  
3.  View the properties of the project in the Properties window.  
  
 Project properties, such as the date created, are read-only and cannot be changed from the Properties window.
