  The properties of a connection saved in a project can be viewed and some can be modified.  
  
### To change the properties of a connection in a project  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the connection, and then click **Properties Window**.  
  
2.  View the connection properties in the Properties window. You can change the **Execution Timeout**, **Database**, and **Login Timeout** properties.
