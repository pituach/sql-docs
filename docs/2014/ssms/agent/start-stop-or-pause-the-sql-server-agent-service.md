# Start, Stop, or Pause the SQL Server Agent Service
  This topic describes how to start, stop, or restart the SQL Server Agent Service in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 You can configure the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service to start automatically when the operating system starts, or you can start it manually when you need to complete jobs. You can stop or pause the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service to suspend jobs, operator notifications, and alerts.

###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent must be running as a service in order to automate administrative tasks. For more information, see [Configure SQL Server Agent](configure-sql-server-agent.md).  
  
-   Object Explorer only displays the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent node if you have permission to use it.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 To perform its functions, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent must be configured to use the credentials of an account that is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The account must have the following Windows permissions:  
  
-   Log on as a service (SeServiceLogonRight)  
  
-   Replace a process-level token (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege)  
  
-   Bypass traverse checking (SeChangeNotifyPrivilege)  
  
-   Adjust memory quotas for a process (SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege)  
  
 For more information about the Windows permissions required for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service account, see [Select an Account for the SQL Server Agent Service](select-an-account-for-the-sql-server-agent-service.md) and [Configure Windows Service Accounts and Permissions](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-windows-service-accounts-and-permissions.md).  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio
