# Designate a Fail-Safe Operator
  A fail-safe operator is a user who receives the alert if the designated operator cannot be reached. This topic describes how to set a fail-safe operator to receive [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent alert notifications in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].

###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   The Pager and **net send** options will be removed from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent in a future version of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Avoid using these features in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use these features.  
  
-   Note that SQL Server Agent must be configured to use Database Mail to send e-mail and pager notifications to operators. For more information, see [Assign Alerts to an Operator](assign-alerts-to-an-operator.md).  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] provides an easy, graphical way to manage jobs, and is the recommended way to create and manage the job infrastructure.

 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can designate fail-safe operators.
