# Create a SQL Server Agent Proxy
  This topic describes how to create a SQL Server Agent proxy in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].  
  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent proxy account defines a security context in which a job step can run. Each proxy corresponds to a security credential. To set permissions for a particular job step, create a proxy that has the required permissions for a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent subsystem, and then assign that proxy to the job step.

     [Limitations and Restrictions](#Restrictions)  
  
     [Security](#Security)  
  
-   **To create a SQL Server Agent proxy, using:**  
  
     [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMSProcedure)  
  
     [Transact-SQL](#TsqlProcedure)  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   You must create a credential before you create a proxy if one is not already available.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent proxies use credentials to store information about Windows user accounts. The user specified in the credential must have "Log on as a batch job" permission on the computer on which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent checks subsystem access for a proxy and gives access to the proxy each time the job step runs. If the proxy no longer has access to the subsystem, the job step fails. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent impersonates the user that is specified in the proxy and runs the job step.  
  
-   Creation of a proxy does not change the permissions for the user that is specified in the credential for the proxy. For example, you can create a proxy for a user that does not have permission to connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. In this case, job steps that use that proxy are unable to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   If the login for the user has access to the proxy, or the user belongs to any role with access to the proxy, the user can use the proxy in a job step.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
  
-   Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role have permission to create, modify, or delete proxy accounts. Users who are not members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role must be added to one of the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent fixed database roles in the **msdb** database to use proxies: **SQLAgentUserRole**, **SQLAgentReaderRole**, or **SQLAgentOperatorRole**.  
  
-   Requires `ALTER ANY CREDENTIAL` permission if creating a credential in addition to the proxy.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To create a SQL Server Agent proxy  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, click the plus sign to expand the server where you want to create a proxy on SQL Server Agent.  
  
2.  Click the plus sign to expand **SQL Server Agent**.  
  
3.  Right-click the **Proxies** folder and select **New Proxy**.  
  
4.  On the **New Proxy Account** dialog box, on the **General** page, enter the name of the proxy account in the **Proxy name** box.  
  
5.  In the **Credential name** box, enter the name of the security credential that the proxy account will use.  
  
6.  In the **Description** box, enter a description for the proxy account  
  
7.  Under **Active to the following subsystems**, select the appropriate subsystem or subsystems for this proxy.  
  
8.  On the **Principals** page, add or remove logins or roles to grant or remove access to the proxy account.  
  
9. When finished, click **OK**.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To create a SQL Server Agent proxy  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- creates credential CatalogApplicationCredential  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
    CREATE CREDENTIAL CatalogApplicationCredential WITH IDENTITY = 'REDMOND/TestUser',   
        SECRET = 'G3$1o)lkJ8HNd!';  
    GO  
    -- creates proxy "Catalog application proxy" and assigns the credential 'CatalogApplicationCredential' to it.  
    EXEC dbo.sp_add_proxy  
        @proxy_name = 'Catalog application proxy',  
        @enabled = 1,  
        @description = 'Maintenance tasks on catalog application.',  
        @credential_name = 'CatalogApplicationCredential' ;  
    GO  
    -- grants the proxy "Catalog application proxy" access to the ActiveX Scripting subsystem.  
    EXEC dbo.sp_grant_proxy_to_subsystem  
        @proxy_name = N'Catalog application proxy',  
        @subsystem_id = 2 ;  
    GO  
    ```
