# SQL Server Agent Properties (Job System Page)
  Use this page to view and modify how the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent Service manages jobs.  
  
## Options  
 **Shutdown time-out interval (in seconds)**  
 Specifies the number of seconds that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent waits for jobs to complete before shutting down. If the job is still running after the interval specified, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent forcefully stops the job.  
  
 **Use a non-administrator proxy account**  
 Sets a non-administrator proxy account for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] and later versions support multiple proxies, therefore this option is only applicable when managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent versions prior to [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)].  
  
 **User name**  
 Type the name of the user for the non-administrator proxy account. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports multiple proxies, therefore this option is only applicable when managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent versions prior to [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)].  
  
 **Password**  
 Type the password of the user for the non-administrator proxy account. [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] and later versions support multiple proxies, therefore this option is only applicable when managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent versions prior to [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)].  
  
 **Domain**  
 Type the domain of the user for the non-administrative proxy account. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports multiple proxies, therefore this option is only applicable when managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent versions prior to [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)].
