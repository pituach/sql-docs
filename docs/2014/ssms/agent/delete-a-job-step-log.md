#### To delete a SQL Server Agent job step log  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.

    USE msdb ;  
    GO

 For more information, see [sp_delete_jobsteplog &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-delete-jobsteplog-transact-sql).  
  
##  <a name="SMO"></a> Using SQL Server Management Objects  
 Use the `DeleteJobStepLogs` methods of the `Job` class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see[SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms162169.aspx).  
  
```  
-- Uses PowerShell to delete all job step log files that have ID values larger than 5.  
$srv = new-object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server("(local)")  
$jb = $srv.JobServer.Jobs["Test Job"]  
$jb.DeleteJobStepLogs(5)  
```
