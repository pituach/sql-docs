# Write Execution Trace Messages to the SQL Server Agent Error Log (SQL Server Management Studio)
  This topic describes how to configure [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent to include execution trace messages in its error log in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   Object Explorer only displays the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent node if you have permission to use it.  
  
-   Because this option can cause the error log to become large, only include execution trace messages in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent error logs when investigating a specific [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent problem.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 To perform its functions, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent must be configured to use the credentials of an account that is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The account must have the following Windows permissions:  
  
-   Log on as a service (SeServiceLogonRight)  
  
-   Replace a process-level token (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege)  
  
-   Bypass traverse checking (SeChangeNotifyPrivilege)  
  
-   Adjust memory quotas for a process (SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege)  
  
 For more information about the Windows permissions required for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service account, see [Select an Account for the SQL Server Agent Service](select-an-account-for-the-sql-server-agent-service.md) and [Configure Windows Service Accounts and Permissions](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-windows-service-accounts-and-permissions.md).  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a>   
#### To write execution trace messages to the SQL Server Agent error log  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, click the plus sign to expand the server that contains the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent error log to which you want to write execution trace messages.  
  
2.  Right-click **SQL Server Agent** and select **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **SQL Server Agent Properties â€“***server_name* dialog box, under **Error log** on the **General** page, select the **Include execution trace messages** check box.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.
