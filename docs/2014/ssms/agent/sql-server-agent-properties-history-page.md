# SQL Server Agent Properties (History Page)
  Use this page to view and modify settings for managing the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service history log.  
  
## Options  
 **Limit size of job history log**  
 Sets limits for the amount of job history information that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent retains in the log.  
  
 **Maximum job history log size (in rows)**  
 Sets the maximum number of rows that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent retains. When the log grows to contain this number of rows, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent removes the oldest rows in the log as new rows are entered.  
  
 **Maximum job history rows per job**  
 Sets the maximum number of rows that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent retains per job. When the history for a particular job grows to contain this number of rows, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent removes the oldest rows in the log as new rows are entered.  
  
 **Remove agent history**  
 Specifies that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent will remove entries that have been in the log longer than a specified length of time. This is a one-time execution to remove the history. If a reoccurring job is needed, create and schedule a maintenance plan with a cleanup job.  
  
 **Older than**  
 Sets the amount of time that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent will retain entries.
