# Modify a SQL Server Agent Proxy
  This topic describes how to modify a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent proxy in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].  
  
 **In This Topic**  
  
-   **Before you begin:**  
  
     [Limitations and Restrictions](#Restrictions)  
  
     [Security](#Security)  
  
-   **To modify a SQL Server Agent proxy, using:**  
  
     [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMSProcedure)  
  
     [Transact-SQL](#TsqlProcedure)  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent proxies use credentials to store information about Windows user accounts. The user specified in the credential must have "Log on as a batch job" permission on the computer on which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent checks subsystem access for a proxy and gives access to the proxy each time the job step runs. If the proxy no longer has access to the subsystem, the job step fails. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent impersonates the user that is specified in the proxy and runs the job step.  
  
-   If the login for the user has access to the proxy, or the user belongs to any role with access to the proxy, the user can use the proxy in a job step.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can create, modify, or delete proxy accounts.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To modify a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent proxy  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, click the plus sign to expand the server that contains the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent proxy account that you want to modify.  
  
2.  Click the plus sign to expand **SQL Server Agent**.  
  
3.  Click the plus sign to expand the **Proxies** folder.  
  
4.  Click the plus sign to expand the subsystem node for the proxy (for example, **ActiveX Script**).  
  
5.  Right-click the proxy account you want to modify and select **Properties**.  
  
6.  In the *proxy_name***Proxy Account Properties** dialog box, make changes to the proxy account as necessary. For more information on the options in this dialog box, see [Create a SQL Server Agent Proxy](create-a-sql-server-agent-proxy.md).  
  
7.  When finished, click **OK**.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To modify a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent proxy  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- Disables the proxy named 'Catalog application proxy'.  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
    EXEC dbo.sp_update_proxy  
        @proxy_name = 'Catalog application proxy',  
        @enabled = 0;  
    GO  
    ```
