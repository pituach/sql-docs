# Modify the Target Server(s) Associated with a SQL Server Agent Master Job
  This topic describes how to modify the target server(s) associated with a SQL Server Agent master job in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent master job cannot be targeted at both local and remote servers.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Unless you are a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role, you can only modify jobs that you own. For detailed information, see [Implement SQL Server Agent Security](implement-sql-server-agent-security.md).  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To modify the target server(s) associated with a SQL Server Agent master job  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** click the plus sign to expand the server that contains the job where you want to modify the target server.  
  
2.  Click the plus sign to expand **SQL Server Agent**.  
  
3.  Click the plus sign to expand the **Jobs** folder.  
  
4.  Right-click the job where you want to modify the target server and select **Properties**.  
  
5.  In the **Job Properties –***job_name* dialog box, under **Select a page**, select **Targets**. For more information on the available options on this page, see [Job Properties: New Job &#40;Targets Page&#41;](job-properties-new-job-targets-page.md).  
  
6.  When finished, click **OK**.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To delete a target server currently associated with a SQL Server Agent master job  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- removes the server SEATTLE2 from processing the Weekly Sales Backupsjob   
    -- assumes that the Weekly Sales Backups job exists  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC sp_delete_jobserver  
        @job_name = N'Weekly Sales Backups',  
        @server_name = N'SEATTLE2' ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
 For more information, see [sp_delete_jobserver &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-delete-jobserver-transact-sql).  
  
#### To associate a target server with the current SQL Server Agent master job  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- assigns the multiserver job Weekly Sales Backups to the server SEATTLE2   
    -- assumes that the Weekly Sales Backups job already exists and that   
    -- SEATTLE2 is registered as a target server for the current instance  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC dbo.sp_add_jobserver  
        @job_name = N'Weekly Sales Backups',  
        @server_name = N'SEATTLE2' ;  
    GO  
    ```
