# Modify a Job
  This topic describes how to change the properties of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)], or SQL Server Management Objects.

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent master job cannot be targeted at both local and remote servers.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
 Unless you are a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role, you can only modify jobs that you own. For detailed information, see [Implement SQL Server Agent Security](implement-sql-server-agent-security.md).  
  
##  <a name="SSMS"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To modify a job  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, expand **Jobs**, right-click the job you want to modify, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **Job Properties** dialog box, update the job's properties, steps, schedule, alerts, and notifications using the corresponding pages.  
  
##  <a name="TSQL"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To modify a job  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, connect to an instance of the Database Engine, and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  On the toolbar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  In the query window, use the following system stored procedures to modify a job.  
  
    -   Execute [sp_update_job &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-update-job-transact-sql) to change the attributes of a job.  
  
    -   Execute [sp_update_schedule &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-update-schedule-transact-sql) to change the scheduling details for a job definition.  
  
    -   Execute [sp_add_jobstep &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-add-jobstep-transact-sql) to add new job steps.  
  
    -   Execute [sp_update_jobstep &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-update-jobstep-transact-sql) to change pre-existing job steps.  
  
    -   Execute [sp_delete_jobstep &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-delete-jobstep-transact-sql) to remove a job step from a job.  
  
    -   Additional stored procedures to modify any SQL Server Agent master job:  
  
        -   Execute [sp_delete_jobserver &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-delete-jobserver-transact-sql) to delete a server currently associated with a job.  
  
        -   Execute [sp_add_jobserver &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-add-jobserver-transact-sql) to associate a server with the current job.  
  
##  <a name="SMO"></a> Using SQL Server Management Objects  
 **To modify a job**  
  
 Use the `Job` class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms162169.aspx).
