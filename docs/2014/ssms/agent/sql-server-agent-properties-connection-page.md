# SQL Server Agent Properties (Connection Page)
  Use this page to view and modify the settings for the connection from the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Options  
 **Alias local host server**  
 Specifies the alias to use to connect to the local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. If you cannot use the default connection options for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent, define an alias for the instance and specify the alias here.  
  
 **Use Windows Authentication**  
 Sets [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Authentication as the authentication method used to connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent connects as the account that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service runs as.  
  
 **Use SQL Server Authentication**  
 Sets [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication as the authentication method used to connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication is provided for backward compatibility. For improved security, use Windows Authentication if possible.  
  
 **Login**  
 Specifies the login name to use to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 **Password**  
 Specifies the password to use to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
