# Job Activity Monitor
  Use this page to view the current activity of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs. Click **Filter** to limit the jobs displayed. The **Agent Job Activity** grid is read-only. Click on the column headers to sort the grid. To modify a job, double-click the job to open the **Job Properties** dialog box. Right-click a job in the grid to start it running all job steps, start at a particular job step, disable or enable the job, refresh the job, delete the job, view the history of the job, or view the properties of the job. Click **Refresh** to update the grid with current information.
