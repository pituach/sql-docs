# Delete a Job Category
  This topic describes how to delete a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent job category in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] or SQL Server Management Objects.  
  
 Job categories help you organize your jobs for easy filtering and grouping. For example, you can organize all your database backup jobs in the Database Maintenance category.

 When you delete a user-defined job category, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent prompts you to reassign the jobs that are assigned to it to another job category. You can only delete user-defined job categories.
