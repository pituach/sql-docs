# Edit an Operator
  This topic describes how to edit an operators' availability for receiving notifications and their e-mail, pager, and net send addresses in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].

     [Limitations and Restrictions](#Restrictions)  
  
     [Security](#Security)  
  
-   **To edit an operator, using:**  
  
     [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMSProcedure)  
  
     [Transact-SQL](#TsqlProcedure)  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   The Pager and **net send** options will be removed from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent in a future version of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Avoid using these features in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use these features.  
  
-   Note that SQL Server Agent must be configured to use Database Mail to send e-mail and pager notifications to operators. For more information, see [Assign Alerts to an Operator](assign-alerts-to-an-operator.md).  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] provides an easy, graphical way to manage jobs, and is the recommended way to create and manage the job infrastructure.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can edit operators.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To edit an operator  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, click the plus sign to expand the server that contains the operator you want to edit.  
  
2.  Click the plus sign to expand **SQL Server Agent**.  
  
3.  Click the plus sign to expand the **Operators** folder.  
  
4.  Right-click the operator that you want to edit and select **Properties**.  
  
     For more information on the available options contained in the *operator_name***Properties** dialog box, see:

##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To edit an operator

2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- updates the operator status to enabled, and sets the days   
    -- (from Monday through Friday, from 8 A.M. through 5 P.M.) when the operator can be paged.   
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC dbo.sp_update_operator   
        @name = N'François Ajenstat',  
        @enabled = 1,  
        @email_address = N'françoisa',  
        @pager_address = N'5551290AW@pager.Adventure-Works.com',  
        @weekday_pager_start_time = 080000,  
        @weekday_pager_end_time = 170000,  
        @pager_days = 64 ;  
    GO  
    ```
