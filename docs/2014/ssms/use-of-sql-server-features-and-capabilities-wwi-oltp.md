# Arguments for External Tools
  Arguments are variables that the Studio environment supplies values for when an external tool is launched from the **Tools** menu. External tools such as Notepad can be added to the **Tools** menu using the **External Tools** dialog box.  
  
 The following table lists arguments for external tools.
