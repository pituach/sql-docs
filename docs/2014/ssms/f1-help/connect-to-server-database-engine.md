# Connect to Server (Database Engine)
  Use this dialog to view or specify options when connecting to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. In most cases, you can connect by entering the computer name of the database server in the **Server name** box and then clicking **Connect**. If you are connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)], use the computer name followed by **\sqlexpress**.  
  
 Many factors can affect your ability to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Options  
 **Server type**  
 When registering a server from Object Explorer, select the type of server to connect to: [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]. The rest of the dialog shows only the options that apply to the selected server type. When registering a server from Registered Servers, the **Server type** box is read-only, and matches the type of server displayed in the Registered Servers component. To register a different type of server, select [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] from the Registered Servers toolbar before starting to register a new server.  
  
 **Server name**  
 Select the server instance to connect to. The server instance last connected to is displayed by default.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To connect to an active user instance of [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] connect using named pipes protocol specifying the pipe name, such as np:\\\\.\pipe\3C3DF6B1-2262-47\tsql\query For more information, see the [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] documentation.  
  
 **Authentication**  
 Two authentication modes are available when connecting to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
 **Windows Authentication Mode (Windows Authentication)**  
 [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Authentication mode allows a user to connect through a Windows user account.  
  
 **SQL Server Authentication**  
 When a user connects with a specified login name and password from a non-trusted connection, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] performs the authentication itself by checking to see if a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login account has been set up and if the specified password matches the one previously recorded. If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not have a login account set, authentication fails, and the user receives an error message.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When possible, use Windows Authentication.  
  
 **User name**  
 Enter the user name to connect with. This option is only available if you have selected to connect using Windows Authentication.  
  
 **Login**  
 Enter the login to connect with. This option is only available if you have selected to connect using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.  
  
 **Password**  
 Enter the password for the login. This option is only editable if you have selected to connect using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.  
  
 **Connect**  
 Click to connect to the server selected above.  
  
 **Options**  
 Click to display additional server connection options, such as registering a server and remembering the password.
