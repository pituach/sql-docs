# Change the Name of a Registered Server or Registered Server Group (SQL Server Management Studio)
  This topic describes how to change the name of a registered server or server group in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. The name can be changed at any time. Changing the name of a server in Registered Servers only changes how the name is displayed. To connect to a different server, you must edit the connection properties of the registered server.
