# Understand Database Diagram Ownership (Visual Database Tools)
  To use Database Diagram Designer it must first be set up by a member of the db_owner role (a role of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases) to control access to diagrams. Each diagram has one and only one owner, the user who created it. For more information on setting up diagramming see [Set Up Database Diagram Designer &#40;Visual Database Tools&#41;](visual-database-tools.md).  
  
 Some points to keep in mind about diagram ownership:  
  
-   Although any user with access to a database can create a diagram, once the diagram has been created, the only users who can see it are the diagram's creator and any member of the db_owner role.  
  
-   Ownership of diagrams can only be transferred to members of the db_owner role. This is only possible if the previous owner of the diagram has been removed from the database.  
  
-   If the owner of a diagram has been removed from the database, the diagram will remain in the database until a member of the db_owner role attempts to open it. At that point the db_owner member can choose to take over ownership of the diagram.
