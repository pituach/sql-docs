# Full-Text Index Dialog Box (Visual Database Tools)
  This dialog box allows you to create a full-text index, for full-text searches on text-based columns in your database tables. A full-text index relies on a regular index, so you must create that first. The regular index must be created on a single, non-null column; it is best to choose a column with small values rather than a column with large ones.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To create a full-text index, you must first create a full-text catalog for the database using an outside tool, such as [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or Enterprise Manager.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Full-text index functionality is not available in every edition of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For a list of features that are supported by the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2014](../../getting-started/features-supported-by-the-editions-of-sql-server-2014.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Selected Full-Text Index**  
 Lists existing full-text indexes. Select an index to show its properties in the grid to the right. If the list is empty, no full-text relationships have been defined for the table.  
  
 **Add**  
 Create a new full-text index.  
  
 **Delete**  
 Delete the full-text index selected in the **Selected Full-Text Index** list.  
  
 **General Category**  
 When expanded, shows **Columns** and **Full-text Catalog Name**.  
  
 **Columns**  
 Displays a comma-separated list of the names of full-text-searchable columns. To see the complete list, click the ellipsis button (**â€¦**) to the left of the property field.  
  
 **Full-Text Catalog Name**  
 Displays the name of the full-text catalog on which this full-text index is stored. To store the index on a different catalog, click the catalog name and choose another from the drop-down list.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The catalog must be created first in an outside tool, such as [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or Enterprise Manager.  
  
 **Identity Category**  
 When expanded, shows the name field for this index.  
  
 **Name**  
 Displays the system-specified name for this full-text index.  
  
 **Table Designer Category**  
 When expanded, shows properties that dictate how the index performs.  
  
 **Active**  
 Indicates whether you can currently perform a full-text search using this full-text index.  
  
 **Change Tracking Setting**  
 Describes the status of change tracking for this index: Manual, Auto, or Off.  
  
 **Crawl Completed**  
 Shows whether the most recent crawl has been completed. If this property value is No, a crawl is currently in progress.  
  
 **End Date And Time Of Current Or Last Crawl**  
 Displays the date and time that the most recent crawl ended.  
  
 **Errors In Current Or Last Crawl**  
 Displays the number of errors in current or most recent crawl.  
  
 **Index Version**  
 Displays the schema version of table at time the crawl started.  
  
 **Rows In Current Or Last Crawl**  
 Displays the number of rows updated in the current or most recent crawl.  
  
 **Start Date And Time Of Current Or Last Crawl**  
 Displays the date and time that the current or most recent crawl started.  
  
 **Time Stamp For Next Crawl**  
 Displays the date and time that the next crawl will start.  
  
 **Type Of Current Or Last Crawl**  
 Displays the type of the current or most recent crawl: Full, Incremental, Update, or Auto Propagation.  
  
 **Unique Index Name**  
 Displays a list of all of the names of columns in this database that have unique single-column indexes. These columns can be used to create a full-text index.
