# Remove Tables from Database Diagrams (Visual Database Tools)
  You can remove a table from your database diagram. Removing a table does not alter your database. The table and its relationships to other tables continue to exist in the database.  
  
### To remove a table from a database diagram  
  
1.  In your database diagram, select the table you want to remove.  
  
2.  Right-click the table and choose **Remove Table from Diagram** from the shortcut menu.  
  
     -or-  
  
     Press the ESC key.  
  
     If the table has unsaved changes as a result of edits you made in the database diagram, a message prompts you to save the table before removing it.  
  
 The table is removed from your diagram but it continues to exist in the database.
