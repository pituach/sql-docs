# Create Self-Joins Automatically (Visual Database Tools)
  If a table has a reflexive relationship in the database, you can join it to itself automatically.  
  
### To create a self-join automatically  
  
1.  Add to the [Diagram pane](visual-database-tools.md) the table you want to work with.  
  
2.  Add the same table again, so that the Diagram pane shows the same table twice within the Diagram pane.  
  
     The [Query and View Designer](query-and-view-designer-tools-visual-database-tools.md) assigns an alias to the second instance by adding a sequential number to the table name. In addition, the Query and View Designer creates a join line between the two rectangles representing the two different ways the table participates in the query.
