# Delete Queries (Visual Database Tools)
  You can delete a query, removing it from the project and permanently deleting it from the file system. Queries deleted using the following procedure are not sent to the Recycle Bin and cannot be recovered.  
  
### To permanently delete a query  
  
1.  From the **View** menu, choose Solution Explorer.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, select the query you want to permanently delete.  
  
3.  Right-click the query and from the shortcut menu, click **Remove**.  
  
4.  In the **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** dialog box, click **Delete**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to remove the query from the project without deleting it, click **Remove**. Then you can right-click the query folder and choose **Add Item** to find and add the query back later.
