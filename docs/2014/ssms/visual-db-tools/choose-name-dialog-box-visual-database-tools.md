# Choose Name Dialog Box (Visual Database Tools)
  This dialog box appears when you choose **Save \<TableName**> , **Save \<DiagramName>**, or **Save \<ViewName>** from the **File** menu.  
  
 **Enter a name for the table, diagram, or view.**  
 Provides a text box where you can type a name for the table, diagram, or view.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can not change a view's name later. You can change a table's name later, but it is best if you make any name changes now. Changing the name of an existing table is risky, because you can invalidate other objects that refer to that table by name.
