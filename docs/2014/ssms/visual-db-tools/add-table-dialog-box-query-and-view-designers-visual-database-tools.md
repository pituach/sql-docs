# Add Table Dialog Box (Query and View Designers) (Visual Database Tools)
  This dialog box lets you add tables, views, user-defined functions, or synonyms to a query or view.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If the table is published for replication, you must make schema changes using the Transact-SQL statement [ALTER TABLE](/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql) or SQL Server Management Objects (SMO). When schema changes are made using the Table Designer or the Database Diagram Designer, it attempts to drop and recreate the table. You cannot drop published objects, therefore the schema change will fail.
