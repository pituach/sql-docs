# Tutorial: SQL Server Management Studio
  The [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] tutorial introduces you to the integrated environment for managing your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] infrastructure. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] presents a graphical interface for configuring, monitoring, and administering instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. It also allows you to deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components used by your applications, such as databases and data warehouses. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] also provides [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)], MDX, DMX, and XML language editors for editing and debugging scripts.  
  
## What You Will Learn  
 This tutorial will help you understand the presentation of information in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] and how to take advantage of the features. Note that this tutorial applies to the complete installation of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] that is included with all editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] except [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)]. Functionality for basic installations of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] and for [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] installations that ship with [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] is slightly different than what is presented in this tutorial.  
  
 The best way to get acquainted with [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] is through hands-on practice. This tutorial will teach you how to manage the components of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] and how to find the features that you use regularly.  
  
 This tutorial is divided into three lessons:  
  
 [Lesson 1: Basic Navigation in SQL Server Management Studio](lesson-1-basic-navigation-in-sql-server-management-studio.md)  
 In this lesson you will learn how to use the components of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], how to reconfigure the environment layout, and how to restore the default layout.  
  
 [Lesson 2: Writing Transact-SQL](lesson-2-writing-transact-sql.md)  
 In this lesson, you will learn how to open Query Editor, how to manage code, and how to use the other new features of Query Editor.  
  
 [Lesson 3: Working with Templates, Solutions, and Script Projects](lesson-3-working-with-templates-solutions-and-script-projects.md)  
 In this lesson you will learn how to use templates, and organize scripts into solutions and projects.  
  
## Requirements  
 This tutorial is intended for experienced database administrators and database developers who are not familiar with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], but who are who are familiar with database concepts and the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] language.  
  
 Your system must have the following installed to use this tutorial:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] or a later version with the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample databases. To enhance security, the sample databases are not installed by default.
