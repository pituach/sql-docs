# Display the Query Window
  When you open multiple query windows, they are displayed as tabbed document windows.  
  
## Viewing Multiple Query Windows  
  
#### To view multiple query windows  
  
1.  On the main toolbar, click **Database Engine Query**. In the **Connect to Database Engine** dialog box, click **Connect**.  
  
2.  In Object Explorer, right-click your server and then click **New Query**. In this case, the Query Editor uses the connection information of the Registered Server.  
  
     Note how the windows appear as tabbed windows to the right of Object Explorer.
