-   [Dataset Properties Dialog Box, Fields](../../2014/reporting-services/dataset-properties-dialog-box-fields.md)

## Options  
 **Name**  
 Type a name for the dataset. The name cannot be the same as a name for any data region or group in the report.  
  
 **Data Source**  
 Select the data source on which to base the dataset. To create a new data source, click **New**.  
  
 **Query type**  
 Select the type of command or query to use for the dataset. Select **Text** to run a query to retrieve data from the database. Select **Table** to use the **TableDirect** feature of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to select all the fields within a table. Select **Stored Procedure** to run a stored procedure by name. **Text** is selected by default and is used for most queries. To edit the selected data source query, click **Query Designer**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Not all query types are supported by all data sources. For example, **Table** is supported only by data source types **OLE DB** and **ODBC**.  
  
 **Query**  
 This option appears when you choose the **Text** command type option. Type a query or import a pre-existing query by clicking **Import**. Click the **Expression** (*fx*) button to edit the expression.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you used a query designer to build a query, the text of the query appears in this box.  
  
 **Table name**  
 Enter the name of the table that you want to use as a dataset. This option appears when you select **Table**.  
  
 **Select or enter stored procedure name**  
 Type or choose the name of the stored procedure that you want to use. Click the **Expression** (*fx*) button to edit the expression. This option appears when you choose the Stored Procedure command type option.  
  
 **Time out (in seconds)**  
 Type the number of seconds until the query times out. The default is 30 seconds. The value for **Time out** must be empty or greater than zero. If it is empty, the query does not time out.
