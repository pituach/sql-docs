# Publish Reports
  From[!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], you can publish either all the reports and shared data sources in a Report Server project to a report server by deploying the project, or you can publish a single report. Before you can publish a report you must specify the URL of the target report server. For more information, see [Set Deployment Properties &#40;Reporting Services&#41;](tools/set-deployment-properties-reporting-services.md).  
  
 You can use the [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] version of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to open, modify, preview, save, and publish both [!INCLUDE[ssRSversion2005](../includes/ssrsversion2005-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssRSversion10](../includes/ssrsversion10-md.md)] reports. For more information, see [Deployment and Version Support in SQL Server Data Tools &#40;SSRS&#41;](tools/deployment-and-version-support-in-sql-server-data-tools-ssrs.md).  
  
### To publish all reports in a project  
  
-   On the **Build** menu, click **Deploy \<report project name>**. Alternatively, in Solution Explorer, right-click the report project and then click **Deploy**. You can view the status of the publishing process in the Output window.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you deploy a Report Server project, the shared data sources in the report project are also deployed.  
  
### To publish a single report  
  
-   In Solution Explorer, right-click the report and then click **Deploy**. You can view the status of the publishing process in the Output window.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you publish a report, you must also deploy the shared data sources that the report uses.
