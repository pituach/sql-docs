# Data Source Properties Dialog Box, General
  Select **General** on the **Data Source Properties** dialog box to display and modify connection information for a data source in the report.  
  
## Options  
 **Name**  
 Type the name of the data source. The data source name must be unique within the report. By default, a general name, such as DataSource1 or DataSource2, is assigned to the data source.  
  
 **Embedded connection**  
 Select this option when you do not want to use a shared data source.  
  
 **Type**  
 Select a data processing extension. The list displays all registered extensions.  
  
 **Connection string**  
 Enter a connection string for the data source. Click **Edit** to build the connection string using the **Connection Properties** dialog box. Click the **Expressions** (*fx*) button to edit the expression.  
  
 **Use shared data source reference**  
 Select this option to link to a shared data source. Select a shared data source from the drop-down list. To edit the selected data source, click **Edit**. If **Use shared data source reference** is selected, **Type** and **Connection string** are disabled.  
  
 **Use a single transaction when processing the queries**  
 Select this option to indicate that datasets that use this data source are run in a single transaction against the database. To include transactions for subreports that use the same data source, set **MergeTransactions** to **True** in the subreport's **Other** properties section of the **Properties** pane.
