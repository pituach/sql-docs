# Lesson 2: Define a Data Connection and Data Table for Parent Report
  After you create a new website project using the ASP.NET website template for Visual C#, your next step is to create a data connection and a data table for the parent report. In this tutorial the data connection is to the AdventureWorks2008 database. You also have the option of connecting to the AdventureWorks2012 database.  
  
### To define a data connection and Data Table by adding a DataSet (for parent report)  
  
1.  On the **Website** menu, select **Add New Item**.  
  
2.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select **DataSet** and click **Add**. When prompted you should add the item to the **App_Code** folder by clicking **Yes**.  
  
     This adds a new XSD file **DataSet1.xsd** to the project and opens the DataSet Designer.  
  
3.  From the Toolbox window, drag a **[TableAdapter](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bz9tthwx\(v=vs.100\).aspx)** control to the design surface. This launches the **TableAdapter** Configuration Wizard.  
  
4.  On the **Choose Your Data Connection** page, click **New Connection**.  
  
5.  If this is the first time youâ€™ve created a data source in Visual Studio, you will see the **Choose Data Source** page. In the **Data Source** box, select **Microsoft SQL Server**.  
  
6.  In the **Add Connection** dialog box, perform the following steps:  
  
    1.  In the **Server name** box, enter the server where the **AdventureWorks2008** database is located.  
  
         The default SQL Server Express instance is **(local)\sqlexpress**.  
  
    2.  In the **Log on to the server** section, select the option that provides you access to the data. **Use Windows Authentication** is the default.  
  
    3.  From the **Select or enter a database name** drop-down list, click **AdventureWorks2008**.  
  
    4.  Click **OK**, and then click **Next**.  
  
7.  If you selected **Use SQL Server Authentication** in the Step 6 (b), select the option whether to include the sensitive data in the string or set the information in your application code.  
  
8.  On the **Save the Connection String to the Application Configuration File** page, type in the name for the connection string or accept the default **AdventureWorks2008ConnectionString**. Click **Next**.  
  
9. On the **Choose a Command Type** page, select **Use SQL Statements**, and then click **Next**.  
  
10. On the **Enter a SQL Statement** page, enter the following Transact-SQL query to retrieve data from the **AdventureWorks2008** database, and then click **Next**.  
  
    ```  
    SELECT ProductID, Name, ProductNumber, SafetyStockLevel, ReorderPoint FROM  Production.Product Order By ProductID  
    ```  
  
     You can also create the query by clicking **Query Builder**, and then verify the query by clicking **Execute Query**. If the query does not return the expected data, you might be using an earlier version of AdventureWorks. For more information about installing the **AdventureWorks2008** version of AdventureWorks, see [Walkthrough: Installing the AdventureWorks Database](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa992075\(v=vs.100\).aspx).  
  
11. On the **Choose Methods to Generate** page, be sure to uncheck **Create methods to send updates directly to the database (GenerateDBDirectMethods)**, and then click **Finish**.  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    >  Be sure to uncheck Create  
  
     You have now completed configuring the ADO.NET DataTable object as the data source for your report. On the DataSet Designer page in Visual Studio, you should see the DataTable object you added, listing the columns specified in the query. DataSet1 contains the data from the Product table, based on the query.  
  
12. Save the file.  
  
13. To preview the data, click **Preview Data** on the **Data** menu, and then click **Preview**.  
  
## Next Task  
 You have successfully created a data connection and a data table for the parent report. Next, you will design the parent report using the Report Wizard.
