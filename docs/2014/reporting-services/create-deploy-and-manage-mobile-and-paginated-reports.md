# Reporting Services (SSRS)
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] provides a full range of ready-to-use tools and services to help you create, deploy, and manage reports for your organization. [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] includes programming features that enable you to extend and customize your reporting functionality.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] is a server-based reporting platform that provides comprehensive reporting functionality for a variety of data sources. [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] includes a complete set of tools for you to create, manage, and deliver reports, and APIs that enable developers to integrate or extend data and report processing in custom applications. [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] tools work within the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] environment and are fully integrated with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tools and components.  
  
 With [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], you can create interactive, tabular, graphical, or free-form reports from relational, multidimensional, or XML-based data sources. Reports can include rich data visualization, including charts, maps, and sparklines. You can publish reports, schedule report processing, or access reports on-demand. You can select from a variety of viewing formats, export reports to other applications such as [!INCLUDE[ofprexcel](../includes/ofprexcel-md.md)], and subscribe to published reports. The reports that you create can be viewed over a Web-based connection or as part of a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows application or SharePoint site. You can also create data alerts on reports published to a SharePoint site and receive email messages when report data changes.
