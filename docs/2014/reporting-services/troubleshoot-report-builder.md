# Troubleshoot Report Builder
  Report Builder is a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report authoring tool that you can use to build reports from many different kinds of data sources and to publish your reports to a report server or SharePoint site. The reports that you create can be viewed in Report Builder, in a Web browser, or as part of a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows application or SharePoint site.  
  
 To learn how to use Report Builder and perform many basic tasks, see the [Tutorials](report-builder-tutorials.md).  
  
 The following topics can help you troubleshoot reports, depending on whether you are a report author or report server administrator.

## How Do I Get Community Assistance  
 You can tap the collective wisdom of other Report Builder users by posing questions in discussion groups, reading Report Builder blogs, or using any of the other community resources mentioned in this article.  
  
 For example, participate in discussion groups to talk with an online group of experienced Report Builder users, including Reporting Services Most Valued Professionals (MVPs), who willingly share their time to answer questions and provide solutions, tips, and expertise.  
  
 Read what the Reporting Services team members have to say in the [Reporting Services team blog](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=118788).
