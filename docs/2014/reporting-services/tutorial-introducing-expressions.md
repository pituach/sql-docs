# Tutorial: Introducing Expressions
  Expressions help you create powerful and flexible reports. This tutorial teaches you to create and implement expressions that use common functions and operators. You will use the **Expression** dialog box to write expressions that concatenate name values, look up values in a separate dataset, display different pictures based on field values, and so on.  
  
 The report is a barred report with alternating row colors in white and a color. The report includes a parameter for selecting the color of the non-white rows.  
  
 The following illustration shows a report similar to the one you will create.

## Requirements  
 For information about requirements, see [Prerequisites for Tutorials &#40;Report Builder&#41;](../reporting-services/report-builder-tutorials.md).  
  
##  <a name="Setup"></a> 1. Create a Table Report and Dataset from the Table or Matrix Wizard  
 Create a table report, a data source, and a dataset. When you lay out the table, you will include only a few fields. After you complete the wizard you will manually add columns. The wizard makes it easy for you to lay out the table and apply a style.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In this tutorial, the query contains the data values, so that it does not need an external data source. This makes the query quite long. In a business environment, a query would not contain the data. This is for learning purposes only.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In this tutorial, the steps for the wizard are consolidated into one procedure. For step-by-step instructions about how to browse to a report server, choose a data source, and create a dataset, see the first tutorial in this series: [Tutorial: Creating a Basic Table Report &#40;Report Builder&#41;](../reporting-services/tutorial-creating-a-basic-table-report-report-builder.md).  
  
#### To create a new table report

    -   CountryRegionID  
  
    -   LastPurchase  
  
    -   YTDPurchase  
  
     Because the CountryRegionID and YTDPurchase contain numeric data, the SUM aggregate is applied to them by default.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The FirstName and LastName fields are not included. You will add them in a later step.  
  
13. In the **Values** list, right-click `CountryRegionID` and click the **Sum** option.  
  
     Sum is no longer applied to CountryRegionID.  
  
14. In the **Values** list, right-click **YTDPurchase** and click the **Sum** option.  
  
     Sum is no longer applied to YTDPurchase.

 Use the **Left** function and the **Concatenate** (**&**) operator in an expression that evaluates to a name that includes an initial and a last name. You can build the expression step by step or skip ahead in the procedure and copy/paste the expression from the tutorial into the **Expression** dialog box.  
  
#### To add the Name column  
  
1.  Right-click the **StateProvince** column, point to **Insert Column**, and then click **Left**.  
  
     A new column is added to the left of the **StateProvince** column.  
  
2.  Click the title of the new column and type **Name**  
  
3.  Right-click the data cell for the **Name** column and click **Expression**.  
  
4.  In the **Expression** dialog box, expand **Common Functions**, and then click **Text**.  
  
5.  In the **Item** list, double-click **Left**.

12. Click **Run** to preview the report.  
  
##  <a name="Gender"></a> 4. Use Images to Display Gender  
 Use images to show the gender of a person, and identify unknown gender values by using a third image. You will add to the report three hidden images and a new column to display the images, and then determine the image that appears in the column based on the value of the Gender field.  
  
 To apply a color to the table cell that contains the image when you make the report a barred report, you will add a rectangle and then add the image to the rectangle. You need to use a rectangle because you can apply a background color to a rectangle, but not to an image.  
  
 The tutorial uses images that are installed with Windows, but you can use any images available to you. You will use embedded images, and they do not need to be installed on your local computer or the report server.  
  
#### To add images to the report body  
  
1.  Click **Design** to return to design view.  
  
2.  On the **Insert** tab of the ribbon, click **Image** and then click in the report body, below the table.

9. Delete the right parenthesis and then type **,Fields!ID.value, Fields!CountryRegion.value, "CountryRegion")**  
  
     The completed expression: `=Lookup(Fields!CountryRegionID.Value,Fields!ID.value, Fields!CountryRegion.value, "CountryRegion")`  
  
     The syntax of the **Lookup** function specifies a lookup between CountryRegionID and ID in the CountryRegion dataset that returns the CountryRegion value, which is also in the CountryRegion dataset.  
  
10. [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
11. Click **Run** to preview the report.  
  
##  <a name="Count"></a> 6. Count Days Since Last Purchase

10. In the **Values** list, double-click **LastPurchase**.  
  
11. If the cursor is not already immediately after `Fields!LastPurchase.Value`, place it there.  
  
12. Type **,**  
  
13. In the **Category** list, click **Date & Time** again.  
  
14. In the **Item** list, double-click **Now**.  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    >  In production reports you should not use the **Now** function in expressions that are evaluated multiple times as the report renders (for example, in the detail rows of a report). The value of **Now** changes from row to row and the different values affect the evaluation results of expressions, which leads to results that are subtly inconsistent. Instead, you should use the `ExecutionTime` global variable that [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] provides.  
  
15. If the cursor is not already immediately after `Now(`, place it there.  
  
16. Delete the left parenthesis and then type **)**  
  
     The completed expression: `=DateDiff("d", Fields!LastPurchase.Value, Now)`
