# Custom Report Item Architecture
  A custom report item is an extension to the Report Definition Language (RDL) that allows developers to add functionality thatâ€™s not natively supported in RDL or extend the functionality of existing controls. There are two main components to a custom report item: the run-time component and the design-time component. These components are implemented as [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] assemblies, and can be written in any CLS-compliant language.  
  
## The Run-Time Component  
 The run-time component for a custom report item is called by the report processor at run time. The run-time component accepts data passed by the report processor at run time, processes this data, and returns an image containing the rendered custom report item.

## The Design-Time Component  
 The design-time component allows the custom report item to be defined and manipulated in the Report Designer interface in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. The design-time component consists of several sub-controls that control the appearance and properties of the custom report item in the design environment.
