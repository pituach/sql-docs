# Using Reporting Services SOAP Headers
  Communication with a Web service method using SOAP follows a standard format. Part of this format is the data that is encoded in an XML document. The XML document consists of a root **Envelope** element, which in turn consists of a required **Body** element and an optional **Header** element. The **Body** element contains the data specific to the message. The optional **Header** element can contain additional information not directly related to the particular message. Each child element of the **Header** element is called a SOAP header.  
  
 Although the SOAP headers can contain data related to the message, they typically contain information processed by the Web server infrastructure.  
  
 The Report Server Web services define several classes for use in the SOAP header: <xref:ReportService2005.BatchHeader>, <xref:ReportService2010.ItemNamespaceHeader>, <xref:ReportService2010.ServerInfoHeader>, <xref:ReportService2010.TrustedUserHeader>, and <xref:ReportExecution2005.ExecutionHeader>.
