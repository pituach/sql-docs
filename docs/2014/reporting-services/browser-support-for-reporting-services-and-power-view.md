# Planning for Reporting Services and Power View Browser Support (Reporting Services 2014)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)], you use a web browser to view reports and run Report Manager. Not all browsers support all report functionality. This topic describes the support and requirements for Report Manager management features, viewing reports, the Report Viewer controls in Visual Studio. The topic also summarizes feature availability for the supported browsers, authentication requirements, and script requirements.  
  
 **[!INCLUDE[applies](../includes/applies-md.md)]**  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint mode | [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Native mode

##  <a name="bkmk_powerview"></a> Power View Browser Scenarios  
 The list of supported browsers and browser versions that [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] supports, depends on what type of document is opened. Excel 2013 workbooks and “**.rdlx**” files utilize different components.  
  
|Document Type|Environment|Browser support|  
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|  
|Power View report (.RDLX)|**SharePoint Server:** [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] on [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint integrated mode and the Power View web application.|See [Power View on SharePoint Server and Reporting Services SharePoint Integrated Mode](#bkmk_powerview_on_SSRS).|  
|Excel 2013 workbook with Power View sheets|**SharePoint Server:** [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] in Excel Services.<br /><br /> **SharePoint Online (Office 365):** [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] on Excel Web App.|See [Power View on Excel Services or the Excel Web App on SharePoint Online](#bkmk_powerview_on_ExcelServices).|  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_powerview_on_SSRS"></a> Power View on SharePoint Server and Reporting Services SharePoint Integrated Mode  
 The following table summarizes the supported browser versions for [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] when a user opens a Power View report (.RDLX) on a SharePoint farm that has a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] service application and the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in for SharePoint installed and configured.  
  
-   The table applies to SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013.

#### InPrivate browsing feature in Internet Explorer  
 [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] does not support the InPrivate browsing feature in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9. For more information about InPrivate browsing, see [What is InPrivate Browsing?](http://windows.microsoft.com/Windows7/What-is-InPrivate-Browsing) (http://windows.microsoft.com/Windows7/What-is-InPrivate-Browsing).

 **<sup>(1)</sup>**  The following features are supported:  
  
-   Export to PDF and TIFF format.  
  
-   Interactively view reports in Apple Safari on iOS devices. Features support includes expand/collapse, the parameter pane, and interactive sorting.  
  
-   For more information, see [View Reporting Services Reports on Microsoft Surface Devices and  Apple iOS Devices](../../2014/reporting-services/view-reporting-services-reports-surface-ios-devices.md).  
  
 **Note** If you are accessing a report server from a Macintosh computer, we recommend that you use Safari. If you are using a SharePoint product that is integrated with [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], see [Plan browser support (Windows SharePoint Services)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=183583).  
  
### URL Access for Viewing Reports  
 To view reports directly, rather than viewing them through Report Manager, you can use URL Access to link to the report and the report viewer. URL access supports a variety of browsers.  
  
 For more information on URL access, see the following topic:  
  
-   [URL Access Parameter Reference](url-access-parameter-reference.md)  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_authentication"></a> Authentication Requirements  
 Browsers support specific authentication schemes that must be handled by the report server in order for the client request to succeed. The following table identifies the default authentication types supported by each browser running on a Windows operating system.  
  
|**Browser type**|**Supports**|**Browser default**|**Server default**|  
|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|  
|**Internet Explorer**|Negotiated, Kerberos, NTLM, Basic|Negotiate|Yes. The default authentication settings work with Internet Explorer.|  
|**Firefox**|NTLM, Basic|NTLM|Yes. The default authentication settings work with Firefox.|  
|**Safari**|Basic|Basic|Yes. The default authentication settings work with Safari.|  
|**Chrome**|Negotiated, NTLM, Basic|Negotiated|Yes. The default authentication settings work with Chrome.|  
  
### Script Requirements  
 To use the report viewer, configure your browser to run scripts.  
  
 If scripting is not enabled, you will see an error message similar to the following when you open a report:  
  
-   **Your browser does not support scripts or has been configured to not allow scripts to run. Click here to view this report without scripts**.  
  
 If you choose to view the report without script support, the report is rendered in HTML without report viewer capabilities such as the report toolbar and the document map.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The report toolbar is part of the HTML Viewer component. By default the toolbar appears at the top of every report that is rendered in a browser window. The report viewer provides features include the ability to search the report for information, scroll to a specific page, and adjust the page size for viewing purposes. For more information about the report toolbar or HTML Viewer, see [HTML Viewer and the Report Toolbar](html-viewer-and-the-report-toolbar.md).  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_controls"></a> Browser Support for ReportViewer Web Server Controls in Visual Studio  
 The ReportViewer Web server control is used to embed report functionality in an ASP.NET web application. The controls are included with Visual Studio and support different browsers and browser versions than the other components described in this topic. The type of browser used to view the application determines the kind of ReportViewer functionality that you can provide in your application. Use the table provided in this topic to determine which of the supported browsers are subject to report functionality restrictions and the supported platforms.  
  
 Due to differences in the rendering engines of the supported browsers, some advance report features may be displayed differently in differnt browsers.  For example, text rotation.  
  
### Scripting Requirements  
 Use a browser that has script support enabled. If the browser cannot run scripts, you cannot view the report.  
  
### Browser Requirements for Viewing Reports with the ReportViewer web server controls  
 Support for interactive report features varies by browser type. The following support matrix shows which browser types are supported on which platforms, subject to constraints noted in the Notes column.

 <sup>1</sup>In standards mode, Internet Explorer 7.0 and 8.0 do not display slanted lines in reports. If you use slanted lines in your reports, set your ASP.NET page to run in quirks mode in Internet Explorer. To do this, find the \<!DOCTYPE> tag in your ASP.NET page. Or, if you use a master page, you can find the tag in the .master file. This tag looks like the following:  
  
```  
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">  
```  
  
 Replace the \<!DOCTYPE> tag with the following tag:  
  
```  
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">  
```
