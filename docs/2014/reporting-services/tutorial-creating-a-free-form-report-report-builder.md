# Tutorial: Creating a Free Form Report (Report Builder)
  This tutorial teaches you how to create an SSRS free form report that resembles a forms letter. You can arrange report items to create a form with text boxes, images and other data regions.  
  
 The report you create in this tutorial is based on sample sales data that is included in the tutorial. The report groups information by territory and displays the name of the sales manager for the territory as well as detailed and summary sales information. You will use the list data region as the foundation for the free form report, and then add a decorative panel with an image, static text with data inserted, a table to show detailed information, and optionally, pie and column charts to display summary information.

## Requirements  
 For more information about requirements, see [Prerequisites for Tutorials &#40;Report Builder&#41;](../reporting-services/report-builder-tutorials.md).  
  
##  <a name="BlankReport"></a> 1. Create a Blank Report, Data Source, and Dataset  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In this tutorial, the query contains the data values so that the report does not need an external data source. The use of this type of internal data is great for learning purposes, but the approach makes the query long. .  
  
#### To create a blank report  
  
1.  Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Report Builder**, and then click **Report Builder**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The **Getting Started** dialog box should appear. If it does not, from the Report Builder button, click **New**.  
  
2.  In the left pane of the **Getting Started** dialog box, verify that **New Report** is selected.  
  
3.  In the right pane, click **Blank Report**.  
  
#### To create a new data source  
  
1.  In the Report Data pane, click **New**, and then click **Data Source**.  
  
2.  In the `Name` box, type: **ListDataSource**  
  
3.  Click **Use a connection embedded in my report**.  
  
4.  Verify that the connection type is Microsoft SQL Server, and then in the **Connection string** box type: **Data Source = \<servername>**  
  
     \<servername>, for example Report001, specifies a computer on which an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine is installed. Because the report data is not extracted from a SQL Server database, you need not include the name of a database. The default database on the specified server is used to parse the query.  
  
5.  Click **Credentials**, and enter the credentials needed to connect to the instance of the SQL Server Database Engine.  
  
6.  Click **OK**.  
  
#### To create a new dataset  
  
1.  In the Report Data pane, click **New**, and then click **Dataset**.  
  
2.  In the `Name` box, type: **ListDataset.**  
  
3.  Click **Use a dataset embedded in my report**, and verify that the data source is **ListDataSource**.  
  
4.  Verify that the **Text** query type is selected, and then click **Query Designer**.  
  
5.  Click **Edit as Text**.  
  
6.  Copy and paste the following query into the query pane:  
  
    ```

8.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
##  <a name="List"></a> 2. Add and Configure a List  
 [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] provides three data region templates: table, matrix, and list. These templates are all based on a tablix data region.  
  
 In this tutorial, you will use a list to display the sales information for sales territories in a report that resembles a newsletter. The information is grouped by territory. You will add a new row group that groups data by territory, and then delete the built-in Details row group. The list template is ideal for creating free form reports. For more information, see [Lists &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](report-design/create-invoices-and-forms-with-lists-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This report uses the paper size Letter (8.5 X11) and 1 inch margins. A report page taller than 9 inches or wider than 6 1/2 inches might generate blank pages.  
  
#### To add a list  
  
1.  On the **Insert** tab of the ribbon, in the **Data Regions** area, click **List** and then drag the list inside the report body. Make the list 7 inches tall and 6.25 inches wide.  
  
2.  Click inside the list, right-click the top of the list, and then click **Tablix Properties**.  
  
     ![Adding list](../../2014/tutorials/media/tutorial-addinglistwithnumbers.png "Adding list")  
  
3.  In the **Dataset name** drop-down list, select **ListDataset**.  
  
4.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
5.  Right-click inside the list, and then click **Rectangle Properties**.

2.  On the **Insert** tab of the ribbon, click **Text Box**, and then drag a text box to the upper left corner of the list, but inside of the rectangle you added previously. Make the text box about 3 inches tall and 5 inches wide.  
  
3.  Place the cursor in the upper part of the text box, and then type: **Newsletter for** .  
  
     ![Add newsletter heading text](../../2014/tutorials/media/tutorial-newsletterfor.png "Add newsletter heading text")  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Be sure to include the extra space after the word "for". The space separates the text and the field that you will add in the next step.  
  
4.  Drag the Territory field to the text box and place it after the text you typed in step 3.
