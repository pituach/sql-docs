# Add Scale Breaks to a Chart (Report Builder and SSRS)
  A scale break is a stripe drawn across the plotting area of a chart to denote a break in continuity between the high and low values on a value axis (usually the vertical, or y-axis). Use a scale break to display two distinct ranges in the same chart area.  
  
 ![Chart with scale break](../media/rs-multipledatarangeschart-scalebreak.gif "Chart with scale break")  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot specify where to place a scale break on your chart. The chart uses its own calculations based on the values in your dataset to determine whether there is sufficient separation between data ranges to draw a scale break on the value axis (y-axis) at run time.  
  
 An example of a chart with scale breaks is available as a sample report. For more information about downloading this sample report and others, see [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)][Report Builder and Report Designer sample reports](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=198283).

### To enable scale breaks on the chart  
  
1.  Right-click the vertical axis and then click **Axis Properties**. The **VerticalAxis Properties** dialog box opens.  
  
2.  Select the **Enable scale breaks** check box.  
  
### To change the style of the scale break  
  
1.  Open the Properties pane.  
  
2.  On the design surface, right-click on the y-axis of the chart. The properties for the y-axis object (named Chart Axis by default) are displayed in the Properties pane.  
  
3.  In the **Scale** section, expand the ScaleBreakStyle property.  
  
4.  Change the values for ScaleBreakStyle properties, such as BreakLineType and Spacing. For more information about scale break properties, see [Displaying a Series with Multiple Data Ranges on a Chart &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](displaying-a-series-with-multiple-data-ranges-on-a-chart.md).
