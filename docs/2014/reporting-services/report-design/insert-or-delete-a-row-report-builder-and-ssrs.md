# Insert or Delete a Row (Report Builder and SSRS)
  You can add or delete rows in a tablix data region. The tablix data region can be a table, a matrix, or a list. The following procedures do not apply to the chart and gauge data regions.  
  
 In a tablix data region, you can add rows that are associated with a group (inside a group) or that are not associated with a group (outside a group). A row that is inside a group repeats once per unique group value. For example, a row inside a group based on the value in a data column that contains color names, repeats once per distinct color name. For nested groups, a row can be outside the child group but inside the parent group. In this case, the row repeats once for each unique value in the parent group.
