# Choose the Table Style or Choose the Matrix Style
  Use these pages of the Report Wizard to select text and line styles for the report. The list of styles is based on a configurable template. Report Designer provides the following initial templates: Slate, Forest, Corporate, Bold, Ocean, and Generic.
