# Schedules Page (Report Manager)
  Use the Schedules page to create, modify, delete, pause, or resume shared schedules. A shared schedule is a named schedule that you can create and manage separately from reports, subscriptions, and other processes that consume schedule information. Users can select shared schedules that you provide.  
  
 To delete, pause, or resume a shared schedule, select the check box next to the shared schedule that you want to modify.
