# Report Model Connection (SSRS)
  To include data from a report model, you must have a dataset that is based on a report model as a data source. Unlike other report data sources, there is no data extension for a report model. In Report Builder, you browse to and select the model directly from the report server. In Report Designer, you specify the URL to the report model.  
  
 Use the information in this topic to build a data source. For step-by-step instructions, see [Add and Verify a Data Connection or Data Source &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](add-and-verify-a-data-connection-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
##  <a name="Connection"></a> Connection String  
 You do not need a connection string to use a report model as a data source. To connect to a report model, browse to a report server or SharePoint site and select a published model. On a SharePoint site, the report model file name extension is .smdl.  
  
 For more connection string examples, see [Data Connections, Data Sources, and Connection Strings in Report Builder](../data-connections-data-sources-and-connection-strings-in-report-builder.md).  
  
  
  
##  <a name="Credentials"></a> Credentials  
 Credentials are required to run queries, to preview the report locally, and to preview the report from the report server.  
  
 After you publish your report, you may need to change the credentials for the data source so that when the report runs on the report server, the permissions to retrieve the data are valid.  
  
 For more information, see [Specify Credentials in Report Builder](../specify-credentials-in-report-builder.md).  
  
  
  
##  <a name="Query"></a> Queries  
 Use the report model query designer to interactively specify entities, fields, and a filter for the query. The entities and fields from the model become the dataset field collection displayed in the Report Data pane.  
  
  
  
##  <a name="Parameters"></a> Parameters  
 To add a report parameter, create a filter with a prompt in the Report Model Query Designer.  
  
 Report parameters are created with default property values that you might need to modify. By default, each report parameter is data type **Text**. If the underlying data is a different data type, you must change the parameter data type.  
  
 For more information, see [Report Parameters &#40;Report Builder and Report Designer&#41;](../report-design/report-parameters-report-builder-and-report-designer.md).  
  
  
  
##  <a name="Remarks"></a> Remarks  
 Not all report delivery modes are supported by this data provider. Delivering reports through data-driven subscriptions is not supported for this data processing extension. For more information, see [Use an External Data Source for Subscriber Data &#40;Data-Driven Subscription&#41;](../subscriptions/use-an-external-data-source-for-subscriber-data-data-driven-subscription.md).
