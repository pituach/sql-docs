# Supported Combinations of SharePoint and Reporting Services Server and Add-in (SQL Server 2014)
  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report servers can be installed in SharePoint mode and integrated with a SharePoint deployment. Not all features are supported in all combinations of report server, Reporting Services add-in for SharePoint, and SharePoint Products. This topic summarizes the supported combinations. In [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] the integration is a result of the combination of the following:  
  
-   A version of a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report server configured for SharePoint mode.  
  
-   A SharePoint product.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in for SharePoint products, which you install on the SharePoint servers.

 For more information on [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] features and report server modes, see [Reporting Services Report Server](../reporting-services-report-server.md).  
  
 **Additional Notes:**  
  
-   SharePoint 2013 support, including Power view integration, requires the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report server and the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in version of SQL Server 2012 SP1 or later.  
  
-   Power View was introduced in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)]. Therefore, Power View integration with SharePoint 2010 requires the [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] or later of the add-in.  
  
-   The SQL Server 2008 R2 Add-In is not supported by SQL Server 2012 (or later) report servers. The SharePoint 2010 prerequisite installer automatically installs the SQL Server 2008 R2 Add-In. It must be uninstalled before installing newer versions of the add-in. In place upgrade of the add-in is not supported.  
  
-   **Upgrade:** SharePoint 2010 with the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Add-In installed, cannot be upgraded in-place to SharePoint 2013. SharePoint 2013 requires [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11SP1](../../includes/sssql11sp1-md.md)] or later of the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in and report server. For more information on upgrade, see [Upgrade and Migrate Reporting Services](upgrade-and-migrate-reporting-services.md).
