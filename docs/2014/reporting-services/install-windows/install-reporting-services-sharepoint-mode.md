# Reporting Services SharePoint Mode Installation (SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013)
  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] in SharePoint mode is a collection of server components that provide report generation and delivery, based on [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] SharePoint products.  
  
 Running [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] in SharePoint mode provides the [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../../includes/sscrescent-md.md)] and data alerting features.
