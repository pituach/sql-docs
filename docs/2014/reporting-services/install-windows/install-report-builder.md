# Install the Stand-Alone Version of Report Builder (Report Builder)
  You can install Report Builder from the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] feature pack on the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=168472) or a location such as public folder to which the ReportBuilder3_x86.msi, the Windows Installer Package for Report Builder, has been downloaded.  
  
 You can also perform a command line installation of Report Builder and provide arguments to customize the installation. In addition to the standard MSI intrinsic parameters, you can use the custom parameters that Report Builder provides: RBINSTALLDIR and REPORTSERVERURL. RBINSTALLDIR specifies the root installation folder for Report Builder. REPORTSERVERURL specifies the default report server that Report Builder uses to save reports on the server.  
  
 If you want a completely silent installation, with no user interface interaction at all, specify the **/quiet** option. By design, the quiet option flag suppresses installation errors. It is therefore recommended that you include the **/l** option, which specifies logging, when you use the quiet option.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Windows Vista and Windows 7 security features require elevated permissions to run command line operations and will prompt for permission to run the command line. The installation is not silent. To make the installation silent, you need to run the command line as an administrator.
