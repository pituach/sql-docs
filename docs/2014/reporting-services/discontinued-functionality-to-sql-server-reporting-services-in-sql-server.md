# Discontinued Functionality to SQL Server Reporting Services in SQL Server 2014
  This topic describes [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] features that are no longer available in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. It does not include announcements about discontinued support for specific versions of the operating system or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Internet Information Services (IIS). For more information about system prerequisites, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2014](../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md).

##  <a name="bkmk_kj"></a> SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services Discontinued Functionality

### 64-bit Platform Support  
 Starting in [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] component no longer supports Itanium-based servers running Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2003 R2. [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] continues to support other 64-bit operating systems, including Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-Based Systems and Windows Server 2008 R2 for Itanium-Based Systems. To upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] from a [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] installation with [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] on an Itanium-based system edition of Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2003 R2, you must first upgrade the operating system.  
  
### Data Source Credentials in URL Access  
 The URL access parameter strings *dsu:datasourcename=value* and *dsp:datasourcename=value* are now discontinued. In prior versions, these parameter strings are stored in plain text in the browser cache, which is not secure.
