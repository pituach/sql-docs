# Dock the Report Data Pane in Report Designer (SSRS)
  In Report Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], the Report Data pane displays a hierarchical view of data objects that you can use in a report, including data sources, datasets, fields, parameters, and images. Data sources in this view can be embedded or references to shared data sources that are displayed in Solution Explorer.  
  
### To display the Report Data pane  
  
-   In Design view, on the **View** menu, select **Report Data**.
