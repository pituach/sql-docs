# New User Role (Management Studio)
  Use this page to create an item-level role definition. An item-level role definition is a named collection of tasks that enumerate the tasks a user can perform in relation to folders, reports, models, resources, and shared data sources. An example of an item-level role definition is the predefined Browser role that identifies the kinds of actions a report end user might require for navigating folders and viewing reports.  
  
 Role definitions are intended to be few in number. Most organizations only require a few role definitions. However, if the predefined role definitions are insufficient, you can vary them or create new ones.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Role definitions are used only on a report server that runs in native mode. If the report server is configured for SharePoint integration, this page is not available.  
  
## Options  
 **Name**  
 Type the name of the role definition. A role definition name must be unique within the report server namespace. A name must contain at least one alphanumeric character. It can also include spaces and some symbols. Do not use the following characters when specifying a name:  
  
 ; ? : @ & = + , $ / * \< >  
  
 " /  
  
 **Description**  
 Type a description that explains how to use the role and enumerates what the role supports.  
  
 **Task**  
 Select the tasks that can be performed through this role. You cannot create new tasks or modify the existing tasks that are supported by [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. Only item-level tasks can be used in an item-level role definition.  
  
 **Task Description**  
 Shows a description of the task that enumerates the operations or permissions that the task supports.
