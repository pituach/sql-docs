# Tutorial: Create a Quick Chart Report Offline (Report Builder)
  In this tutorial, you'll create a pie chart by using a wizard, and then you'll modify it a little, just to get an idea of what's possible. You can do this tutorial two different ways. Both methods have the same outcomeâ€”a pie chart like the one in the following illustration:  
  
 !["My First Pie Chart" in Run view](../media/rs-my1stpierunview.gif ""My First Pie Chart" in Run view")  
  
## Prerequisites  
 Whether you use XML data or a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] query, you need to have access to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Report Builder. You can run the stand-alone version or the ClickOnce version available from Report Manager or a SharePoint site. Only the first step, how to open Report Builder, is different for ClickOnce versions. For more information, see [Install, Uninstall, and Report Builder Support](../install-uninstall-and-report-builder-support.md).  
  
##  <a name="TwoWays"></a> Two Ways To Do This Tutorial  
  
-   [Create the pie chart with XML data](#CreatePieChartXML)  
  
-   [Create the pie chart with a Transact-SQL query that contains data](#CreatePieQueryData)  
  
### Using XML data for this tutorial  
 You can use XML data that you copy from this topic and paste into the wizard. You don't need to be connected to a report server or a report server in SharePoint integrated mode, and you don't need access to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
 [Create the pie chart with XML data](#CreatePieChartXML)  
  
### Using a Transact-SQL query that contains data for this tutorial  
 You can copy a query with data included in it from this topic and paste it into the wizard. You will need the name of an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and credentials sufficient for read-only access to any database. The dataset query in the tutorial uses literal data, but the query must be processed by an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] to return the metadata that is required for a report dataset.  
  
 The advantage of using the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] query is that all the other Report Builder tutorials use the same method, so when you do the other tutorials, you will already know what to do.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] query does require a few other prerequisites. For more information, see [Prerequisites for Tutorials &#40;Report Builder&#41;](../report-builder-tutorials.md).

##  <a name="CreatePieChartXML"></a> Creating the pie chart with XML data  
  
#### To create the pie chart with XML data  
  
1.  Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Report Builder**, and then click **Report Builder**.  
  
     The **Getting Started** dialog box appears.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the **Getting Started** dialog box does not appear, from the **Report Builder** button, click **New**.  
  
2.  In the left pane, verify that **Report** is selected.  
  
3.  In the right pane, click **Chart Wizard**, and then click **Create**.  
  
4.  In the **Choose a dataset** page, click **Create a dataset**, and then click **Next**.  
  
5.  In the **Choose a connection to a data source** page, click **New**.  
  
     The **Data Source Properties** dialog box opens.  
  
6.  You can name a data source anything you want. In the **Name** box, type **MyPieChart**.  
  
7.  In the **Select connection type** box, click **XML.**  
  
8.  Click the **Credentials** tab, select **Use current Windows user. Kerberos delegation may be required**, and then click **OK**.  
  
9. In the **Choose a connection to a data source** page, click **MyPieChart**, and then click **Next**.  
  
10. Copy the following text and paste it in the large box in the center of the **Design a query** page.  
  
    ```  
    <Query>  
    <ElementPath>Root /S  {@Sales (Integer)} /C {@FullName} </ElementPath>  
    <XmlData>  
    <Root>  
    <S Sales="150">  
      <C FullName="Jae Pak" />  
    </S>  
    <S Sales="350">  
      <C FullName="Jillian  Carson" />  
    </S>  
    <S Sales="250">  
      <C FullName="Linda C Mitchell" />  
    </S>  
    <S Sales="500">  
      <C FullName="Michael Blythe" />  
    </S>  
    <S Sales="450">  
      <C FullName="Ranjit Varkey" />  
    </S>  
    </Root>  
    </XmlData>  
    </Query>  
    ```  
  
11. (Optional) Click the Run button (**!**) to see the data your chart will be based on.  
  
12. Click **Next**.  
  
13. In the **Choose a chart type** page, click **Pie**, and then click **Next**.  
  
14. In the **Arrange chart fields** page, double-click the **Sales** field in the **Available fields** box.  
  
     Note that it automatically moves to the **Values** box, because it is a numerical value.  
  
15. Drag the **FullName** field from the **Available fields** box to the **Categories** box (or double-click it; it will go to the **Categories** box), and then click **Next**.  
  
16. In the **Choose a style** page, **Ocean** is selected by default. Click the other styles to see what they look like.  
  
17. Click **Finish**.  
  
     You're now looking at your new pie chart report on the design surface. What you see is representational. The legend reads Full Name 1, Full Name 2, etc., rather than the salespeople's names, and the size of the slices of pie are not accurate. This is just to give you an idea of what your report will look like.  
  
18. To see your actual pie chart, click **Run** on the **Home** tab of the Ribbon.

#### To create the pie chart with a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] query that contains data  
  
1.  Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Report Builder**, and then click **Report Builder**.  
  
2.  In the **New report or dataset** dialog box, verify that **Report** is selected in the left pane.  
  
3.  In the right pane, click **Chart Wizard**, and then click **Create**.  
  
4.  In the **Choose a dataset** page, click **Create a dataset**, and then click **Next**.  
  
5.  In the **Choose a connection to a data source** page, select an existing data source or browse to the report server and select a data source, and then click **Next**. You may need to enter a user name and password.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The data source you choose is unimportant, as long as you have adequate permissions. You will not be getting data from the data source. For more information, see [Prerequisites for Tutorials &#40;Report Builder&#41;](../report-builder-tutorials.md).  
  
6.  On the **Design a Query** page, click **Edit as Text**.  
  
7.  Paste the following query into the query pane:  
  
    ```  
    SELECT 150 AS Sales, 'Jae Pak' AS FullName   
    UNION SELECT 350 AS Sales, 'Jillian Carson' AS FullName   
    UNION SELECT 250 AS Sales, 'Linda C Mitchell' AS FullName   
    UNION SELECT 500 AS Sales, 'Michael Blythe' AS FullName   
    UNION SELECT 450 AS Sales, 'Ranjit Varkey' AS FullName   
    ```  
  
8.  (Optional) Click the Run button (**!**) to see the data your chart will be based on.  
  
9. Click **Next**.  
  
10. In the **Choose a chart type** page, click **Pie**, and then click **Next**.  
  
11. In the **Arrange chart fields** page, double-click the **Sales** field in the **Available fields** box.  
  
     Note that it automatically moves to the **Values** box, because it's a numerical value.

##  <a name="AfterWizard"></a> After You Run the Wizard  
 Now that you have your pie chart report, you can play with it. On the **Run** tab of the Ribbon, click **Design**, so you can continue modifying it.  
  
### Make the chart bigger  
 You may want the pie chart to be bigger. Click the chart, but not on any element in the chart, to select it and drag the lower-right corner to resize it.  
  
### Add a report title  
 Select the words **Chart title** at the top of the chart, and then type a title, such as **Sales Pie Chart**.  
  
### Add percentages  
  
##### To display percentage values as labels on a pie chart  
  
1.  Right-click on the pie chart and select **Show Data Labels**. The data labels should appear within each slice on the pie chart.  
  
2.  Right-click on the labels and select **Series Label Properties**. The **Series Label Properties** dialog box appears.  
  
3.  Type `#PERCENT{P0}` for the **Label data** option.  
  
     The `{P0}` gives you the percentage without decimal places. If you type just `#PERCENT`, your numbers will have two decimal places. `#PERCENT` is a keyword that performs a calculation or function for you; there are many others.  
  
 For more information about customizing chart labels and legends, see [Display Percentage Values on a Pie Chart &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../report-design/display-percentage-values-on-a-pie-chart-report-builder-and-ssrs.md) and [Change the Text of a Legend Item &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../report-design/chart-legend-change-item-text-report-builder.md).

##  <a name="WhatsNext"></a> What's Next?  
 Now that you have created your first report in Report Builder, you are ready to try the other tutorials and to start creating reports from your own data. To run Report Builder, you need permission to access your data sources, such as databases, with a *connection string*, which actually connects you to the data source. Your system administrator will have this information and can set you up.  
  
 To work through the other tutorials, you need the name of an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and credentials sufficient for read-only access to any database. Your system administrator can also set that up for you.  
  
 Finally, to save your reports to a report server or a SharePoint site that is integrated with a report server, you need the URL and permissions. You can run any report you create directly from your computer, but reports have more functionality when run from the report server or SharePoint site. You need permissions to run your reports or others from the report server or SharePoint site where they are published. Talk to your system administrator to obtain access.  
  
 It may help to read about some of the concepts and terms before you get started. For more information, see [Report Authoring Concepts &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../report-design/report-authoring-concepts-report-builder-and-ssrs.md). Also, spend some time planning, before you create your first report. It will be time well spent. For more information, see [Planning a Report &#40;Report Builder&#41;](../report-design/planning-a-report-report-builder.md).
