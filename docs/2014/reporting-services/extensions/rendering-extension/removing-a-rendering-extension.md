# Removing a Rendering Extension
  To remove a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] rendering extension, simply remove the `Extension` element for your rendering extension from the rsreportserver.config file, located in **%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS10_50.\<Instance Name>\Reporting Services\ReportServer** folder. If you made entries for a Report Designer as well as a report server, remove the `Extension` element from the [RSReportDesigner Configuration File](../../report-server/rsreportdesigner-configuration-file.md) as well. After the configuration information is removed, the rendering extension is no longer available to the component.
