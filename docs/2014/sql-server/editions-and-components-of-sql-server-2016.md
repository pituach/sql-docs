# Editions and Components of SQL Server 2014
  Installation requirements vary based on your application needs. The different editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] accommodate the unique performance, runtime, and price requirements of organizations and individuals. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components that you install also depend on your specific requirements. The following sections help you understand how to make the best choice among the editions and components available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Principal Editions of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]  
 The following table describes the principal editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2014](../getting-started/features-supported-by-the-editions-of-sql-server-2014.md)  
  
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition|Definition|  
|---------------------------------------|----------------|  
|Enterprise (64-bit and 32-bit)|The premium offering, [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Enterprise edition delivers comprehensive high-end datacenter capabilities with blazing-fast performance, unlimited virtualization, and end-to-end business intelligence — enabling high service levels for mission-critical workloads and end user access to data insights.|  
|Business Intelligence (64-bit and 32-bit)|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Business Intelligence edition delivers comprehensive platform empowering organizations to build and deploy secure, scalable and manageable BI solutions. It offers exciting functionality such as browser based data exploration and visualization; powerful data mash-up capabilities, and enhanced integration management.|  
|Standard (64-bit and 32-bit)|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Standard edition delivers basic data management and business intelligence database for departments and small organizations to run their applications and supports common development tools for on-premise and cloud — enabling effective database management with minimal IT resources.|  
  
## Specialized Editions of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]  
 Specialized editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are targeted for business workloads. The following table describes the specialized editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition|Description|  
|---------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|Web (64-bit and 32-bit)|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Web edition is a low total-cost-of-ownership option for Web hosters and Web VAPs to provide scalability, affordability, and manageability capabilities for small to large scale Web properties.|  
  
## Breadth Editions of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]  
 Breadth editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are engineered for specific customer scenarios and are offered FREE or at a very nominal cost. The following table describes the breadth editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition|Description|  
|---------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|Developer (64-bit and 32-bit)|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Developer edition lets developers build any kind of application on top of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. It includes all the functionality of Enterprise edition, but is licensed for use as a development and test system, not as a production server. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Developer is an ideal choice for people who build and test applications.|  
|Express (64-bit and 32-bit) editions|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Express edition is the entry-level, free database and is ideal for learning and building desktop and small server data-driven applications. It is the best choice for independent software vendors, developers, and hobbyists building client applications. If you need more advanced database features, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Express can be seamlessly upgraded to other higher end versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Express LocalDB, a lightweight version of Express that has all of its programmability features, yet runs in user mode and has a fast, zero-configuration installation and a short list of prerequisites.|  
  
## Using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with an Internet Server  
 On an Internet server, such as a server that is running Internet Information Services (IIS), you will typically install the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client tools. Client tools include the client connectivity components used by an application connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Although you can install an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a computer that is running IIS, this is typically done only for small Web sites that have a single server computer. Most Web sites have their middle-tier IIS systems on one server or a cluster of servers, and their databases on a separate server or federation of servers.  
  
## Using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with Client/Server Applications  
 You can install just the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client components on a computer that is running client/server applications that connect directly to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. A client components installation is also a good option if you administer an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a database server, or if you plan to develop [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] applications.  
  
 The client tools option installs the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features: backward compatibility components, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)], connectivity components, management tools, software development kit, and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online components. For more information, see [Install SQL Server 2014 from the Installation Wizard &#40;Setup&#41;](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-installation-wizard-setup.md).  
  
## Deciding Among [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Components  
 Use the Feature Selection page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Wizard to select the components to include in an installation of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. By default, none of the features in the tree are selected.
