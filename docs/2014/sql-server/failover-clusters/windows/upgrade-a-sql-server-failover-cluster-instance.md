# Upgrade a SQL Server Failover Cluster
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports upgrade of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../includes/ssde-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] from [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] failover clusters separately on all failover cluster nodes.  
  
 Support details are as follows:  
  
-   Upgrade is supported both through the user interface and from the command prompt. For more information, see [Upgrade a SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance &#40;Setup&#41;](upgrade-a-sql-server-failover-cluster-instance-setup.md) and [Install SQL Server 2014 from the Command Prompt](../../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt.md).  
  
-   Upgrading from [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] — You can run upgrade from the command prompt on each failover cluster node, or by using the Setup UI to upgrade each cluster node. If Full-text search and Replication features do not exist on the instance being upgraded, they will be installed automatically with no option to omit them.  
  
-   Service pack installation - you must apply [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service packs and patches to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] failover clusters separately on all nodes.  
  
-   The following scenarios are not supported:  
  
    -   You cannot migrate from a stand-alone instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to a failover cluster.  
  
    -   Add features to a failover cluster. For example, you cannot add the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../includes/ssde-md.md)] to an existing [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]-only failover cluster.  
  
    -   You cannot downgrade a failover cluster node to a stand-alone instance.  
  
-   For more information, see [ AlwaysOn Failover Cluster Instances (SQL Server)](always-on-failover-cluster-instances-sql-server.md).  
  
## Upgrading a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Multi-Subnet Failover Cluster  
 You cannot directly upgrade a non–multi-subnet [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] multi-subnet failover cluster. For more information, see [Upgrade a SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance &#40;Setup&#41;](upgrade-a-sql-server-failover-cluster-instance-setup.md).
