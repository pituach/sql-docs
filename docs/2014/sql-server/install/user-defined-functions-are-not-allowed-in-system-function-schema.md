# User-defined functions are not allowed in system_function_schema
  The Upgrade Advisor detected user-defined functions that are owned by the undocumented user **system_function_schema**. You cannot create a user-defined system function by specifying this user. The **system_function_schema** user name does not exist, and the user ID that is associated with this name (UID = 4) is reserved for the **sys** schema and is restricted to internal use only.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Description  
 System object storage and access has changed in the following ways:  
  
-   System objects are stored in the read-only **Resource** database, and direct system object updates are not permitted.  
  
     System objects logically appear in the **sys** schema of every database. This maintains the ability to invoke system functions from any database by specifying a one-part function name. For example, the statement `SELECT * FROM fn_helpcollations()` can be run from any database.  
  
-   The undocumented user **system_function_schema** has been removed.  
  
-   The user ID associated with **system_function_schema** (UID = 4) is reserved for the **sys** schema and is restricted to internal use only.  
  
 These changes have the following effect on user-defined system functions:  
  
-   Data Definition Language (DDL) statements that reference **system_function_schema** will fail. For example, the statement `CREATE FUNCTION system`_`function`\_`schema.fn`\_`MySystemFunction` â€¦ will not succeed.  
  
-   After you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)], existing objects that are owned by **system_function_schema** are contained only in the **sys** schema of the **master** database. Because system objects cannot be modified, these functions can never be changed or dropped from the **master** database. Additionally, these functions cannot be invoked from other databases by specifying only a one-part function name.  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Before you upgrade , complete the following tasks:  
  
1.  Change the ownership of existing user-defined functions to **dbo** by using the **sp_changeobjectowner** system stored procedure.  
  
2.  Consider renaming the function so that is does not use the prefix 'fn_'. This will avoid potential name conflicts with current or future system functions.  
  
3.  Add a copy of the modified functions in every database that uses them.  
  
4.  Replace references to **system_function_schema** with **dbo** in all scripts that contain user-defined function DDL statements.  
  
5.  Modify scripts that invoke these functions to use either the two-part name dbo**.***function_name*, or the three-part name *database_name***.**dbo.*function_name*.
