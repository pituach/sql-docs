# After upgrade, new reserved keywords cannot be used as identifiers
  Upgrade Advisor detected the use of words that are reserved keywords. A reserved keyword cannot be used as an identifier or object name unless the name is delimited.  
  
## Component  
 Database Engine  
  
## Description  
 At compatibility level 90 or lower, the following words are not reserved keywords and can be used as identifiers or object names in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] scripts. At compatibility level 100, these words are fully reserved keywords and should not be used as identifiers or object names.  
  
-   EXTERNAL  
  
-   MERGE  
  
-   PIVOT  
  
-   REVERT  
  
-   STOPLIST  
  
-   TABLESAMPLE  
  
-   UNPIVOT  
  
## Corrective Action  
 We recommend that you rename the object. If that cannot be done before upgrading, use one of the following methods until the name can be changed:  
  
-   Retain the database compatibility level setting of 90 or lower.  
  
-   Refer to the object by using delimited identifiers. For example, the statement `CREATE TABLE [MERGE] ([MERGE] int);` uses brackets to delimit the object name MERGE.
