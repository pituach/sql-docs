# Running Upgrade Advisor (Command Prompt)
  Use the **UpgradeAdvisorWizardCmd** utility to run Upgrade Advisor from the command prompt. You can choose to receive results in XML format or in a file with comma-separated values.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      UpgradeAdvisorWizardCmd [ -? ]  |   
    [ -ConfigFilefilename | <server_info> ]  
    [ -SqlUserlogin_id-SqlPasswordpassword ]  
    [ -CSV ]  
  
where <server_info> is any combination of the following:  
        -Serverserver_name-Instanceinstance_name-ASInstanceAS_instance_name-RSInstanceRS_instance_name  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 **-?**  
 Displays the command syntax.  
  
 **-ConfigFile** *filename*  
 Is the path name and file name of an XML file that contains settings to use when you run the **UpgradeAdvisorWizardCmd** utility.  
  
 *<server_info>*  
 Specifies which computer and instance to analyze. Use these options if you are not using a configuration file.  
  
 *<server_info>* can be any combination of the following four arguments:  
  
 **-Server** *server_name*  
 Specifies the name of the computer to analyze. This can be the local computer, which is the default value, or a remote computer.  
  
 **-Instance** *instance_name*  
 Specifies the name of the instance to analyze. There is no default value. If you do not specify this parameter, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] is not scanned. The value for a default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is MSSQLSERVER. For a named instance, use the instance name.  
  
 **-ASInstance**  *AS_instance_name*  
 Specifies the name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] to analyze. There is no default value. If you do not specify this value, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] is not scanned. The value for a default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] is MSSQLServerOLAPService. For a named instance, use the instance name.  
  
 **-RSInstance**  *RS_instance_name*  
 Specifies the name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] to analyze. There is no default value. If you do not specify this value, [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] is not scanned. The value for a default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] is ReportServer. For a named instance, use the instance name.  
  
 **-SqlUser** *login_id*  
 If you are using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication, this value is the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login that Upgrade Advisor will use to connect to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. If you do not specify a login, Windows Authentication is used to connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.  
  
 **-SqlPassword** *password*  
 If you use the **-SqlUser** argument, use this argument to specify the password for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login.  
  
 **-CSV**  
 Specifies to provide results as comma-separated values to a .csv file in addition to the standard XML results. Results are written to the My Documents\\[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Upgrade Advisor\110\Reports folder.  
  
## Return Values  
 The following table shows the values that **UpgradeAdvisorWizardCmd** returns.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|0|Analysis succeeded, no upgrade issues found.|  
|positive integer|Analysis succeeded, upgrade issues found.|  
|negative integer|Analysis failed.|  
  
## Remarks  
 All information that is required to run the analysis, other than [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication user names and passwords, can be provided in an XML configuration file. This XML configuration file is documented in the template. If you do not use a configuration file, you can analyze all installed components in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using default settings by specifying computer names and instance names. See the "Element Descriptions" table later in this topic for a description of the default configuration file settings.  
  
## Configuration File Template  
 Use the following XML as a template for creating your own configuration files. You can modify the template to meet the needs of your organization.  
  
```xml  
<Configuration>  
    <Server> </Server>  
    <Instance></Instance>  
    <Components>  
        <SQLServer>  
            <Databases>

```  
  
### C. Run Upgrade Advisor Using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication  
 The following example shows how to run Upgrade Advisor from the command prompt by using a configuration file. This example specifies a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] user name and password to connect to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
```
