# Repair PowerPivot for SharePoint
  You can use the PowerPivot Configuration Tool to repair an existing installation of PowerPivot for SharePoint. The tool reads the configuration settings for a local PowerPivot for SharePoint instance and provides actions for re-configuring a setting that is inconsistent with a PowerPivot for SharePoint installation. For example, if you stop a service or retract a solution, the tool will offer actions to start the service and deploy the solution.  
  
 For more information, see [Configure or Repair PowerPivot for SharePoint 2010 &#40;PowerPivot Configuration Tool&#41;](../../../2014/analysis-services/configure-repair-powerpivot-sharepoint-2010.md).
