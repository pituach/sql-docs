# osql no longer supports the ED and !! commands
  The **osql** utility does not support the **ED** and **!!** commands.  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Remove references to the **ED** and **!!** commands from your scripts.  
  
 If you want to use the **ED** and **!!** commands, use the **sqlcmd** utility instead of **osql**.
