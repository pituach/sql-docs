# Use sp_rename to rename duplicate index name
  Upgrade Advisor has detected duplicate table or view index names. Rename the indexes to remove duplicates before upgrading.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Corrective Action  
  
1.  Locate the duplicate indexes by executing the following query.  
  
    ```  
    SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT_NAME(o.id), name  
    FROM sysindexes as o  
    WHERE EXISTS   
        (SELECT name FROM sysindexes  as i  
          WHERE i.id = o.id  
          AND i.name = o.name and i.indid < o.indid);  
    ```  
  
2.  Use **sp_rename** to change one of the index names. Because the index names are the same, you cannot determine which index will be renamed. This step allows you to differentiate the indexes.  
  
    ```  
    EXEC sp_rename N'table_name.index_name', N'new_index_name', N'INDEX'  
    ```  
  
3.  Verify which index was renamed by executing the following query. This query returns all indexes (including key column names) on the specified table or view.  
  
    ```  
    SELECT i.name AS IndexName, c.name AS ColumnName, ik.colid, ik.keyno  
    FROM sysindexes i  
    JOIN sysindexkeys ik ON i.id = ik.id and i.indid = ik.indid   
    JOIN syscolumns c ON c.id = ik.id and ik.colid = c.colid  
    WHERE i.id = OBJECT_ID('table_or_view_name')  
    ```  
  
4.  If necessary, use **sp_rename** again to correct the index names.
