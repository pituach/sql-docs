# SQL Server 2014 Upgrade Advisor
  [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Upgrade Advisor analyzes the configuration of installed [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components, and then generates a report of issues that you must address to assure a successful upgrade.  
  
 Get the Upgrade Advisor installation file (sqlua.msi) in the redist folder of the installation media, or as part of the [SQL 2014 Feature Pack download](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42295).
