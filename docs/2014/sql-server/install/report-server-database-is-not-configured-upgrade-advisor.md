# Report server database is not configured (Upgrade Advisor)
  Upgrade is blocked due to an incomplete report server configuration. The report server database is not configured.

|**[!INCLUDE[applies](../../includes/applies-md.md)]**  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Native mode &#124; [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint mode.|  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]  
  
## Description  
 Setup can only upgrade a fully configured report server instance. To continue, you must either configure the report server database, or use Microsoft Windows **Control Panel** to remove the report server feature from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation. After you remove [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], you can upgrade other [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components.  
  
## Corrective Action  
 If you did not configure the report server database, the report server is not operational and should be removed prior to upgrade.  
  
 For additional information on uninstalling [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] , see [Uninstall Reporting Services 2012](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh479745.aspx\(v=sql.11\)). the topic describes how to uninstall a specific version and the procedures are similar for previous versions as well.
