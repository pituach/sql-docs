# SQL Server Agent Service cannot use SQL Server Authentication
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent only supports Windows Authentication when the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service connects to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent  
  
## Description  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service can only log on to the database using Windows Authentication. This means that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service account must be a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] user.  
  
 For more information, see the topics "Security for Automatic Administration" and "Implementing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent Security" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.
