# Remove DDL operations on the inserted and deleted tables inside DML triggers
  Data definition language (DDL) statements, such as CREATE INDEX, cannot be performed on the inserted and deleted tables inside DML triggers. Some DDL statements on the inserted and deleted tables are permitted in earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see "Using the inserted and deleted Tables" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Remove any DDL operations that are performed on the inserted and deleted tables inside DML triggers.
