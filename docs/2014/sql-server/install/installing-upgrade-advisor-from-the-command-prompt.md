 `SQLUA.msi [options]`

|/q[n&#124;b&#124;r&#124;f]|Sets user interface (UI) level:<br /><br /> n = no UI<br /><br /> b = basic UI (progress only, no prompts)<br /><br /> r = reduced UI (dialog box at the end of installation)<br /><br /> f = full UI|  
|/L|Specifies log file options. To log all messages to *log_file_name*, use **-L\*v***log_file_name*. To log error messages only, use `-Le`*log_file_name*.|
