# How to: Filter Reports
  This topic describes how you can use the Upgrade Advisor Report Viewer to apply filters to a report.  
  
### To filter reports  
  
1.  In the report viewer, display the report that you want to filter. For instructions, see [How to: View an Upgrade Advisor Report](../../../2014/sql-server/install/how-to-view-an-upgrade-advisor-report.md).  
  
2.  In the **Filter by** list, select a type of issue to view:  
  
    -   **All issues**. This displays all issues that have not been marked as resolved.  
  
    -   **All upgrade issues**. This displays all issues that are related to upgrading to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
    -   **Pre-upgrade issues**. This displays all issues that should or must be fixed before upgrading to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
    -   **All migration issues**. This displays all issues that are related to migrating data or applications to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
    -   **Resolved Issues**. This displays all issues that have been marked as resolved.  
  
    -   **Unresolved Issues**. This displays all issues that have not yet been resolved.
