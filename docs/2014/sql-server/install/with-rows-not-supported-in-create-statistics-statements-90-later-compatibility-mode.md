# WITH ROWS is not supported in CREATE STATISTICS statements in the compatibility mode of 90 or later
  Specifying WITH ROWS in CREATE STATISTICS statements is not supported when you run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] set to the compatibility mode of 90 or later.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Modify CREATE STATISTICS statements that include WITH ROWS by specifying WITH SAMPLE *number* ROWS, or by specifying other options that comply with the documented syntax. For more information, see the topic "CREATE STATISTICS (Transact-SQL) in SQL Server Books Online.
