# Verify all filegroups are writeable during the upgrade process
  Upgrade Advisor detected a database that has one or more read-only filegroups. All databases in the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] must have filegroups set to READ_WRITE before upgrading.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Use ALTER DATABASE to set the filegroup to READ_WRITE.
