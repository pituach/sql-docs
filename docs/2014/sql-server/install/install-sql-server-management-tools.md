 Note that [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] is a separate option during [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation.  
  
 Regardless of how many instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] are installed on a computer, only one copy of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Management Tools will be installed.
