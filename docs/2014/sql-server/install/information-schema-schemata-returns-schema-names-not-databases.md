# INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA returns schema names in a database, not databases in an instance
  Upgrade Advisor detected statements that reference the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA view. In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], this view returned all databases in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. In [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] and later, the view returns all schemas in a database.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Description  
 In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA view returned all databases in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Now, the view returns all schemas in a database, which complies with the SQL Standard.  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Modify your application to reference the **sys.databases** catalog view to return all databases in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
