# Log shipping will not run after upgrading
  Upgrade Advisor has detected that you are using log shipping. [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../includes/ssversion2000-md.md)] log shipping is incompatible with log shipping in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and cannot be upgraded directly. After upgrading to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)], reconfigure log shipping using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or stored procedures.
