# How to: Export Reports
  Upgrade Advisor Report Viewer enables you to export a flat-file version of the report. This enables you to work with the information in a spreadsheet or word processing document, or to e-mail the information to other people.  
  
### To export a report  
  
1.  In the report viewer, display the report that you want to export. For instructions, see [How to: View an Upgrade Advisor Report](../../../2014/sql-server/install/how-to-view-an-upgrade-advisor-report.md).  
  
2.  To filter the report, select a value from the **Filter by** box.  
  
3.  Click **Export Report**.  
  
4.  In the **Export report file** dialog box, type a file name, choose a destination, and then click **OK**. The file is saved in CSV (comma separated value) format. You can use Microsoft Excel or similar applications to open the file. If you want the data in another format, you can copy the information from Excel into Microsoft Word or other applications.
