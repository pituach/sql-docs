# Invalid named pipe name can block upgrade
  Upgrade fails if the named pipes protocol is incorrectly configured.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Description  
 During upgrade, the Setup program starts the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] instance with shared memory support, a named pipe that only accepts local connections. If the pipe name specified on the server is not blank, it must begin with the string "\\\\.\pipe\\" to be valid. If the pipe name is not valid, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] will not start, and setup will fail.  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Use the **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Network Utility** to supply a valid pipe name, and then run Setup.
