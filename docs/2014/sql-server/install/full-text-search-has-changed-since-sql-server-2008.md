# Full-Text Search has changed since SQL Server 2008
  Upgrade Advisor detected that full-text search is going to be upgraded. Many full-text search options and settings have changed. Therefore, when you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Full-Text Search, some of your settings might need modification.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Description  
 Several full-text search features, settings and objects have been modified since [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] and many of your existing settings will not be maintained when you upgrade.  
  
## Corrective Action  
 We also recommend reviewing full-text search documentation in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online for breaking changes and best practices when you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].
