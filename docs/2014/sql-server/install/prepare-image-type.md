# Prepare Image Type
  Use the **Prepare Image Type** page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Wizard to specify whether to install a new instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], or add features to an existing instance.  
  
## Options  
 Select the radio button that specifies your choice:  
  
-   Prepare a new instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   Add features to an existing prepared instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  
  
     If you select the option to add features to an existing instance, use the drop-down list to select the prepared instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to update.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can add the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] SysPrep supported features to a prepared image of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
