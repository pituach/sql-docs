# Reporting Services SharePoint Mode Authentication
  Use the **Reporting Services SharePoint Mode Authentication** page of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Wizard to specify the credentials of the service account that is used in the current [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] installation. The credentials will be used to create a new SharePoint application pool. Also, one new [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint service application will be created. The service application name will contain the name of the previous [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] instance name.  
  
## Options  
  
-   The **SSRS Application Pool Account Name:** option is read only. The value is automatically populated with the current value from the existing [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] installation that you are upgrading.  
  
-   The **SSRS Application Pool Account Password:** option will be disabled if the application pool account does not require a password. For example, “NT Authority\NetworkSerivce”. If the application pool account does require a password, you cannot continue with upgrade until you type the correct password.
