# New column in output of sp_helptrigger may impact applications
  trigger_schemaias the last column in the result set returned by the sp_helptrigger system stored procedure.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)] To obtain information about triggers defined on a particular table, query the sys.triggers catalog view.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Review the use of sp_helptrigger in applications. You may need to modify your applications to accommodate the additional column. Alternatively, you can use the sys.triggers catalog view instead.
