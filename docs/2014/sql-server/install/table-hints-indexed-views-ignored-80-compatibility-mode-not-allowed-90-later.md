# Table hints in indexed view definitions are ignored in 80 compatibility mode and are not allowed in 90 mode or later
  Table hints in the definitions of indexed views are not permitted in the compatibility mode of 90 or later. For more information, see the following topics in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online: "Designing Indexed Views," "Creating Indexed Views," and "Query Hint ([!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)])."  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Table hints must be removed from the definitions of indexed views. Regardless of which compatibility mode is used, we recommend that you test the application. By testing the application, you can make sure it performs as expected when indexed views are created, updated, and accessed, including when indexed views are matched to queries.
