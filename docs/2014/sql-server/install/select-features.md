# Select Features
  Use the Feature Selection page to select [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components and features to update.  
  
## Options  
 Click a feature name in the left pane to see language, operating system, edition, and status details.  
  
 To update a component or feature, select the check box next to the feature name. To exclude a component or feature from this update, clear the check box next to the feature name.  
  
 Multiple instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a single computer can be updated at different times, but all components within an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] must be updated at the same time. All shared components, such as Workstation Components, MSXML Parser, SQLXML, Backward Compatibility components, and VSS Writer, must be updated.  
  
 If a component cannot be updated, an explanation will be provided in the Details pane.
