# Checklists for Installing BI Features with SharePoint
  This section provides checklists for installing SQL Server BI features in different combinations or in scale-out topologies. If you already know how to run a Setup program to install a BI feature, a checklist is the next step towards understanding the recommended installation order, and whether additional configuration changes are required to enable feature integration scenarios.
