# Modify UPDATETEXT statements that read and write to binary large objects (BLOBs)
  Upgrade Advisor detected UPDATETEXT statements that read and write to the same binary large objects (BLOB) by using the same text pointer. [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] does not support the use of text pointers in this manner.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Copy the BLOB to a temporary table or to a table variable, and then assign the value back to the original column.
