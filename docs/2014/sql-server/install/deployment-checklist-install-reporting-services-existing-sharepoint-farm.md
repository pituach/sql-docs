# Deployment Checklist: Install Reporting Services into an Existing SharePoint Farm
  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint report servers can be installed into a new SharePoint Farm or into an existing SharePoint farm. This topic describes the possible scenarios and best practices for installing [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] into and existing SharePoint farm.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 Before you run Setup, review the following information:  
  
|Step|Link|  
|----------|----------|  
|Create or identify the accounts used in a report server deployment. You must have a service account for the Report Server service, and credentials for connecting to the report server database||  
|Decide on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to host the report server database. You can use a local or remote instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You should choose an instance that is on a computer that has the storage capacity to accommodate your reports.||  
|(Optional) Find the name of the SMTP server or gateway that provides e-mail service to your organization if you want to use report server e-mail in subscriptions|[Configure a Report Server for E-Mail Delivery &#40;SSRS Configuration Manager&#41;](../../../2014/sql-server/install/configure-a-report-server-for-e-mail-delivery-ssrs-configuration-manager.md)|  
|Note: If you are upgrading a computer from a previous CTP release [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and you had made custom changes to the configuration files, you will need to make the same changes to the configuration files, following the upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. The affected files are **web.config** and **client.config**.||  
  
## Installation Scenarios  
 The following table describes the possible scenarios when you are installing [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] into and existing SharePoint Farm. Local mode allows reports to be rendered locally from the SharePoint document library, without integration with a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report server. The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in for SharePoint products is required but a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report server is not. For more information on local mode, see [Local Mode vs. Connected Mode Reports in the Report Viewer &#40;Reporting Services in SharePoint Mode&#41;](../../../2014/reporting-services/local-vs-connected-mode-report-viewer-reporting-services-sharepoint-mode.md) and [Where to find the Reporting Services add-in for SharePoint Products](../../reporting-services/install-windows/where-to-find-the-reporting-services-add-in-for-sharepoint-products.md).
