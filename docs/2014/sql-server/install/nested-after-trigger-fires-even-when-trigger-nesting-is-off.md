# Nested AFTER trigger fires even when trigger nesting is OFF
  Upgrade Advisor detected an AFTER trigger nested inside an INSTEAD OF trigger that is defined on one or more tables. Nested AFTER triggers may fire even when the `nested triggers` server configuration option is set to 0.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Description  
 The first AFTER trigger nested inside an INSTEAD OF trigger fires even if the `nested triggers` server configuration option is set to 0. However, under this setting, subsequent AFTER triggers do not fire.  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Review your applications for nested triggers to determine whether the applications still comply with your business rules with regard to this new behavior when the `nested triggers` server configuration option is set to 0, and then make appropriate modifications.
