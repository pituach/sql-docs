|Issue|Description|Applies to|  
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|  
|SharePoint farm upgrade|Upgrade the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] shared service only after all other [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] components in the farm have been upgraded to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)].<br /><br /> To upgrade [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] in a multi node SharePoint farm to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], all instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in for SharePoint in the farm must be upgraded to the [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] version before you upgrade the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] shared service.<br /><br /> Report rendering will fail when the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint shared service has been upgraded to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] but other [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] components in the farm are still version [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)].<br /><br /> <br /><br /> For more information, see [SQL Server 2014 Reporting Services Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=391254).|[!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11SP1](../../includes/sssql11sp1-md.md)]|  
|Side by Side installation|[!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Native Mode cannot run side by side with either of the following:<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in for SharePoint<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] SharePoint shared service<br /><br /> <br /><br /> The side by side installation prevents the [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Native Mode Windows Service from starting. Error messages similar to the following will be seen in the Windows Event log:<br /><br /> Description: The report server database is an invalid version.<br /><br /> Description: Report Server [server name] cannot connect to the report server database.|[!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] Native mode|  
|Error during the repair of a failed upgrade|**Issue:** You attempt to run a repair after an upgrade has failed. The repair operation also fails and you see messages similar to the following in the setup log files:<br /><br /> `(01) 2011-10-27 12:23:15 Slp:` <br /> `(01) 2011-10-27 12:23:15 Slp: Exception type: System.Exception` <br /> `(01) 2011-10-27 12:23:15 Slp:     Message:`  <br /> `(01) 2011-10-27 12:23:15 Slp:         SQLPath element is missing` <br /> `(01) 2011-10-27 12:23:15 Slp:     Data:`  <br /> `(01) 2011-10-27 12:23:15 Slp:       SQL.Setup.FailureCategory = ConfigurationFailure`<br /><br /> For more information on the log files, see [View and Read SQL Server Setup Log Files](../../database-engine/install-windows/view-and-read-sql-server-setup-log-files.md).<br /><br /> **Solution:** You need to uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] and reinstall [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. An upgrade is no longer possible.|[!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11SP1](../../includes/sssql11sp1-md.md)]|  
|Interactivity information saved only for the last request.|In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], snapshots saved all possible combinations of interactive choices, such as drill through information and toggle choices. For example, you could view page five of a report, but programmatically toggle an item on page one by keeping track of the correct ID for the toggle.<br /><br /> In [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)], interactivity information is generated and saved only for the last rendering request. You cannot view a page and programmatically toggle an item on another page. You can only toggle drilldown items on the current report page.|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 SP2|  
|Rendering and pagination have changed.|The Rendering Object Model (ROM) changed in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. Earlier versions of the rendering object model are no longer supported. Accessing the Rendering Object Model from a multi-threaded rendering extension (and switching context from multiple threads) is not supported.|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 SP2|  
|Redesigned CSV export format.|In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], when you exported a report to a CSV file format, the data was formatted in a way that preserved the way the data appeared on the report page. For matrix data regions, this resulted in a data format that was inconvenient to import into other applications.<br /><br /> In this release, when you export a report to a CSV file, you can choose between two supported formats: Default mode and Compliant mode. Default mode is optimized for Excel. Compliant mode is optimized for third-party applications.<br /><br /> The earlier format for CSV files is no longer available. However, for reports that do not use matrix data regions, you can use Compliant mode to get a file format closest to the earlier CSV file format.|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 SP2|  
|Aggregates with conditional visibility in page headers and footers.|In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], different renderers used different rules to determine which items with conditional visibility to include on a report page. For example, aggregate calculations were not performed for hidden items in printed reports, but were calculated for hidden items in reports that you viewed with a browser or in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Office Excel.<br /><br /> In this release, all renderers use the same set of rules to determine which items are on a page.|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 SP2|  
|No formula support in Excel.|In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], there was limited support for translating expressions in RDL to Excel formulas. In this release, when you export a report to Excel, RDL expressions are not translated to Excel formulas.|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 SP2|  
|Overlapping items.|In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], if a report had overlapping items on the report design surface, publishing the report produced a warning ("Overlapping report items are not supported in all renderers."), but the report items remained in their original location on the design surface. In [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)], report items may be moved to correct overlapping boundaries when a report is viewed or exported to a renderer that does not support overlapping items.|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 SP2|  
|Report object model namespace change.|In [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], the Report Object Model namespace has changed. This namespace provides read-only access from custom code to global collections like `Fields`, `Parameters`, and `ReportItems`. If existing custom code explicitly uses a fully qualified reference to an earlier namespace, this change is a breaking change.<br /><br /> It is recommended that you do not use fully qualified references to access built-in collections from your code. By not explicitly specifying the namespace, custom code references resolve to the version of the report object model for the currently installed version of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 SP2|  
|Report Server Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Provider from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2000 or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 is not supported.|[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] includes a WMI provider that you can use to programmatically configure the environment in which a report server runs. The [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] release of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] includes an all-new version of the WMI provider that completely replaces the previous version. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2000 and 2005 versions are not supported in this release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 SP2|  
|Service Principal Names (SPN) are not recreated on an upgraded report server.|If you created an SPN for the Report Server Web service, verify that constrained delegation still works for the upgraded report server.|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 SP2|  
|Custom assemblies must be moved manually to the new installation folder.|Custom assemblies are not detected by upgrade advisor, and they must be moved manually to the new installation folder if you want to continue using the custom functionality in reports.<br /><br /> If these assemblies are installed in the report server installation folder, they need to be moved to the new installation folder after the upgrade completes.|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 SP2|
