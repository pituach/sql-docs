# Remove colon following reserved keyword
  The Upgrade Advisor detected a script that contains a colon (:) following a reserved keyword. In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], this syntax is ignored and the statements execute successfully. Now, this syntax causes the statement to fail when the database compatibility mode is set to 100 or later.  
  
 User databases maintain their compatibility mode.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Before you change the database compatibility mode to 100 or later, modify your scripts by removing colons that follow reserved keywords. For more information, see "sp_dbcmptlevel" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.
