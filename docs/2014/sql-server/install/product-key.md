# Product Key
  Use the Product Key page to validate your instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], or to specify which free edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to install.  
  
## Options  
 To specify a free edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], select the radio button for free installations, and then use the drop-down box to identify which edition to install.  
  
 To validate a paid edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], select the radio button for the Product Key, and then provide your key in the space provided.  
  
 For failover cluster installations, use the same product key for each failover cluster node. If the product key is from a different [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition, an error will occur.
