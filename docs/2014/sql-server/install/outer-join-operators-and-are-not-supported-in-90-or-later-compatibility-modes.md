# Outer join operators *= and =* are not supported in 90 or later compatibility modes
  Upgrade Advisor detected the use of outer join operators *= and =\*. These operators are not supported in 90 or later compatibility modes. When you upgrade, user databases maintain their compatibility mode. Statements that use these operators will fail.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Corrective Action  
 Before you change the database compatibility mode to 90 or later, modify statements that use the outer join operators *= and =\* to use equivalent OUTER JOIN keywords. The following example shows a query that uses the `*=` operator and an equivalent query that uses the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` keywords.  
  
```  
-- This query uses an old-style outer join operator.  
USE pubs  
SELECT employee.job_id, employee.emp_id,  
   employee.fname, employee.minit, jobs.job_desc  
FROM employee, jobs   
WHERE employee.job_id *= jobs.job_id  
ORDER BY employee.job_id  
  
-- This query uses the ANSI standard keywords LEFT OUTER JOIN.  
USE pubs;  
SELECT employee.job_id, employee.emp_id,  
   employee.fname, employee.minit, jobs.job_desc  
FROM employee LEFT OUTER JOIN jobs ON   
    employee.job_id = jobs.job_id  
ORDER BY employee.job_id  
```
