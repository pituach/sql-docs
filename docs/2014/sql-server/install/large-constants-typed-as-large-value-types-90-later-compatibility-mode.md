# Large constants are typed as large-value types in 90 or later compatibility modes
  Upgrade Advisor detected the presence of large constants. Character string constants and binary constants that are more than 8,000 bytes in size are treated as large object data types in [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../includes/ssversion2000-md.md)]. In [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] or later versions, large character, Unicode, and binary constants, are typed as large-value types.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Description  
 When string functions, such as CHARINDEX and PATINDEX, are used with string or binary constants that exceed 8,000 bytes, [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../includes/ssversion2000-md.md)] returns error number 8116, and [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] or later versions return error number 8152.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../includes/ssversion2000-md.md)], the string functions return error 8116 when they are used with the `text`, `ntext`, and `image` data types.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] or later versions, the large constants are treated as `varchar(max)`, `nvarchar(max)`, and `varbinary(max)` data types, respectively. These data types are compatible with string functions.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] or later versions, string functions, such as CHARINDEX and PATINDEX, assume the string that contains the sequence of characters to be found is less than 8,000 bytes. This is why error 8152 is raised for CHARINDEX and PATINDEX.
