# Read-only databases cannot be upgraded
  Upgrade Advisor has determined that some databases on this instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cannot be upgraded.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
## Description  
 A read-only database has been detected. To upgrade the database, Setup must be able to write to the database.  
  
## Corrective Action  
 When no one is using the database, use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Enterprise Manager, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], or the ALTER DATABASE statement to change the database to read-write. The following statement changes the database to read-write.  
  
```  
USE master;  
GO  
ALTER DATABASE <database name>  
SET READ_WRITE;  
GO  
```  
  
 For more information about the ALTER DATABASE statement, see the "ALTER DATABASE ([!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)])" topic in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.
