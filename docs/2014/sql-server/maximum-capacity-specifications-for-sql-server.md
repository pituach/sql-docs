# Maximum Capacity Specifications for SQL Server
  The following tables specify the maximum sizes and numbers of various objects defined in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components. To navigate to the table for a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] technology, click on its link:

##  <a name="Engine"></a> [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] Objects  
 The following table specifies the maximum sizes and numbers of various objects defined in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases or referenced in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements.  
  
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] object|Maximum sizes/numbers [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (32-bit)|Maximum sizes/numbers [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (64-bit)|  
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|Batch size<br /><br /> Note: Network Packet Size is the size of the tabular data stream (TDS) packets used to communicate between applications and the relational [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)]. The default packet size is 4 KB, and is controlled by the network packet size configuration option.|65,536 * Network Packet Size|65,536 * Network Packet Size|  
|Bytes per short string column|8,000|8,000|  
|Bytes per GROUP BY, ORDER BY|8,060|8,060|  
|Bytes per index key<br /><br /> Note: The maximum number of bytes in any index key cannot exceed 900 in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You can define a key using variable-length columns whose maximum sizes add up to more than 900, provided no row is ever inserted with more than 900 bytes of data in those columns. In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can include nonkey columns in a nonclustered index to avoid the maximum index key size of 900 bytes.|900|900|  
|Bytes per foreign key|900|900|  
|Bytes per primary key|900|900|  
|Bytes per row<br /><br /> Note:<br />        [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports row-overflow storage which enables variable length columns to be pushed off-row. Only a 24-byte root is stored in the main record for variable length columns pushed out of row; because of this, the effective row limit is higher than in previous releases of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see the "Row-Overflow Data Exceeding 8 KB" topic in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.|8,060|8,060|  
|Bytes per row in memory-optimized tables<br /><br /> Note:<br />        [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] In-Memory OLTP does not support row-overflow storage. Variable length columns are not pushed off row. This limits the maximum width of variable-length columns you can specify in a memory-optimized table to the maximum row size. For more information, see [Table and Row Size in Memory-Optimized Tables](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/table-and-row-size-in-memory-optimized-tables.md).|Not supported|8,060|  
|Bytes in source text of a stored procedure|Lesser of batch size or 250 MB|Lesser of batch size or 250 MB|  
|Bytes per `varchar(max)`, `varbinary(max)`, `xml`, `text`, or `image` column|2^31-1|2^31-1|  
|Characters per `ntext` or `nvarchar(max)` column|2^30-1|2^30-1|  
|Clustered indexes per table|1|1|  
|Columns in GROUP BY, ORDER BY|Limited only by number of bytes|Limited only by number of bytes|  
|Columns or expressions in a GROUP BY WITH CUBE or WITH ROLLUP statement|10|10|  
|Columns per index key<br /><br /> Note: If the table contains one or more XML indexes, the clustering key of the user table is limited to 15 columns because the XML column is added to the clustering key of the primary XML index. In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can include nonkey columns in a nonclustered index to avoid the limitation of a maximum of 16 key columns. For more information, see [Create Indexes with Included Columns](../relational-databases/indexes/create-indexes-with-included-columns.md).|16|16|  
|Columns per foreign key|16|16|  
|Columns per primary key|16|16|  
|Columns per nonwide table|1,024|1,024|

|Data files for memory-optimized data per database|Not supported|4.096|  
|Delta file per data file for memory-optimized data|Not supported|1|  
|Foreign key table references per table<br /><br /> Note: Although a table can contain an unlimited number of FOREIGN KEY constraints, the recommended maximum is 253. Depending on the hardware configuration hosting [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], specifying additional FOREIGN KEY constraints may be expensive for the query optimizer to process.|253|253|  
|Identifier length (in characters)|128|128|  
|Instances per computer|50 instances on a stand-alone server for all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] editions.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports 25 instances on a failover cluster when using a shared cluster disk as the stored option for you cluster installation [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports 50 instances on a failover cluster if you choose SMB file shares as the storage option for your cluster installation For more information, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2014](install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md).|50 instances on a stand-alone server.<br /><br /> 25 instances on a failover cluster when using a shared cluster disk as the stored option for you cluster installation [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports 50 instances on a failover cluster if you choose SMB file shares as the storage option for your cluster installation.|
