# Use an Expression in a Precedence Constraint
  This procedure describes how to add an expression to a precedence constraint by using the **Precedence Constraint Editor** dialog box. Before you can add an expression to a precedence constraint, the package must include at least two executables, either tasks or containers, and they must be connected by a precedence constraint.  
  
### To add an expression to a precedence constraint  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  Click the **Control Flow** tab.  
  
4.  On the design surface of the **Control Flow** tab, double-click the precedence constraint. The **Precedence Constraint Editor** opens.  
  
5.  Select **Expression**, **Expression and Constraint**, or **Expression or Constraint** in the **Evaluation operation** list.  
  
6.  Type an expression in the **Expression** text box or launch the Expression Builder to create an expression.  
  
7.  To validate the expression syntax, click **Test**.  
  
8.  To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.
