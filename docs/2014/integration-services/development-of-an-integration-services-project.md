# Development of an Integration Services Project
  You add [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages to projects. To create and work with [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] projects, you must install the [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] environment. For more information, see [Install Integration Services](install-windows/install-integration-services.md).  
  
 When you create a new [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], the **New Project** dialog box includes an **Integration Services Project** template. This project template creates a new project that contains a single package.  
  
## Projects and Solutions  
 Projects are stored in solutions. You can create a solution first and then add an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project to the solution. If no solution exists, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] automatically creates one for you when you first create the project. A solution can contain multiple projects of different types.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  By default, when you create a new [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)], the solution is not shown in the **Solution Explorer** pane. To change this default behavior, on the **Tools** menus, click **Options**. In the **Options** dialog box, expand **Projects and Solutions**, and then click **General**. On the **General** page, select **Always show solution**.
