# View Path Metadata in the Data Flow Path Editor
  Paths connect two data flow components. Before you can view path metadata, the data flow must contain at least two connected data flow components. For more information, see [Add or Delete a Component in a Data Flow](data-flow/add-or-delete-a-component-in-a-data-flow.md) and [Connect Components in a Data Flow](data-flow/connect-components-in-a-data-flow.md).  
  
### To view path metadata  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  Click the **Data Flow** tab and double-click a path.  
  
4.  In **Data Flow Path Editor** dialog box, click **Metadata**.  
  
5.  View path metadata, including the column names, data type, precision, scale, length, code page, and the name of the source component of each column.  
  
6.  To copy the metadata, click **Copy to Clipboard**.  
  
7.  Click **OK**.
