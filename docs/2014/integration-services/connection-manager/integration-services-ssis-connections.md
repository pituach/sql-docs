# Integration Services (SSIS) Connections
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages use connections to perform different tasks and to implement [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] features:  
  
-   Connecting to source and destination data stores such as text, XML, Excel workbooks, and relational databases to extract and load data.  
  
-   Connecting to relational databases that contain reference data to perform exact or fuzzy lookups.  
  
-   Connecting to relational databases to run SQL statements such as SELECT, DELETE, and INSERT commands and also stored procedures.  
  
-   Connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to perform maintenance and transfer tasks such as backing up databases and transferring logins.  
  
-   Writing log entries in text and XML files and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tables and package configurations to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tables.  
  
-   Connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to create temporary work tables that some transformations require to do their work.  
  
-   Connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] projects and databases to access data mining models, process cubes and dimensions, and run DDL code.  
  
-   Specifying existing or creating new files and folders to use with Foreach Loop enumerators and tasks.  
  
-   Connecting to message queues and to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO), Web, and mail servers.  
  
 To make these connections, [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] uses connection managers, as described in the next section.  
  
## Connection Managers  
 [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] uses the connection manager as a logical representation of a connection. At design time, you set the properties of a connection manager to describe the physical connection that [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] creates when the package runs. For example, a connection manager includes the `ConnectionString` property that you set at design time; at run time, a physical connection is created using the value in the connection string property.  
  
 A package can use multiple instances of a connection manager type, and you can set the properties on each instance. At run time, each instance of a connection manager type creates a connection that has different attributes.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] provides different types of connection managers that enable packages to connect to a variety of data sources and servers:  
  
-   There are built-in connection managers that Setup installs when you install [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   There are connection managers that are available for download from the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] website.  
  
-   You can create your own custom connection manager if the existing connection managers do not meet your needs.
