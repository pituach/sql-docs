# Connect Components with Paths
  You construct the data flow in a package on the design surface of the **Data Flow** tab in the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer. If a data flow contains two data flow components, you can connect them by connecting the output of a source or transformation to the input of a transformation or destination. The connector between two data flow components is called a path.  
  
 The following diagram shows a simple data flow with a source component, two transformations, a destination component, and the paths that connect them.  
  
 ![Data flow](media/mw-dts-08.gif "Data flow")  
  
 After two components are connected, you can view the metadata of the data that moves through the path and the properties of the path in **Data Flow Path Editor**. For more information, see [Integration Services Paths](data-flow/integration-services-paths.md).  
  
 You can also add data viewers to paths. A data viewer makes it possible to view data moving between data flow components when the package is run.
