 **To view upgraded packages that were upgraded from SQL Server Data Tools**  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], in Solution Explorer, open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project, and then expand the **SSIS Packages** node to see the upgraded packages.
