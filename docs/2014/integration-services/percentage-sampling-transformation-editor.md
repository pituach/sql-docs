# Percentage Sampling Transformation Editor
  Use the **Percentage Sampling Transformation Editor** dialog box to split part of an input into a sample using a specified percentage of rows. This transformation divides the input into two separate outputs.  
  
 To learn more about the percentage sampling transformation, see [Percentage Sampling Transformation](data-flow/transformations/percentage-sampling-transformation.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Percentage of rows**  
 Specify the percentage of rows in the input to use as a sample.  
  
 The value of this property can be specified by using a property expression.  
  
 **Sample output name**  
 Provide a unique name for the output that will include the sampled rows. The name provided will be displayed within the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer.  
  
 **Unselected output name**  
 Provide a unique name for the output that will contain the rows excluded from the sampling. The name provided will be displayed within the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer.  
  
 **Use the following random seed**  
 Specify the sampling seed for the random number generator that the transformation uses to create a sample. This is only recommended for development and testing. The transformation uses the Microsoft Windows tick count if a random seed is not specified.
