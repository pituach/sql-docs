# Create a New Integration Services Project
  This procedure creates a new project and a new [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] solution.  
  
### To create a new Integration Services project  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.  
  
3.  In the **New Project** dialog box, in the **Templates** pane, select the **Integration Services Project** template.  
  
     The **Integration Services Project** template creates an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains a single, empty package.  
  
4.  (Optional) Edit the project name and the location.  
  
     The solution name is automatically updated to match the project name.  
  
5.  To create a separate folder for the solution file, select **Create directory for solution**. This is the default option.  
  
6.  If source control software is installed on the computer, select **Add to source control**  to associate the project with source control.  
  
7.  If the source control software is [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual SourceSafe, the **Visual SourceSafe Login** dialog box opens. In **Visual SourceSafe Login**, provide a user name, a password, and the name of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual SourceSafe database. Click **Browse** to locate the database.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To view and change the selected source control plug-in and to configure the source control environment, click **Options** on the **Tools** menu, and then expand the **Source Control** node.  
  
8.  Click **OK** to add the solution to **Solution Explore**r and add the project to the solution.
