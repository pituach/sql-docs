# Save SSIS Package (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
  Use the **Save SSIS Package** page to name, describe, and save a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Integration Services ([!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../includes/ssis-md.md)]) package to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] `msdb` database or to a file that has the .dtsx extension.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)], the option to save the package created by the wizard is not available.  
  
 To learn more about this wizard, see [SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md). To learn about the options for starting the wizard, and about the permissions required to run the wizard successfully, see [Run the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](start-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).  
  
 The purpose of the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard is to copy data from a source to a destination. The wizard can also create a destination database and destination tables for you. However, if you have to copy multiple databases or tables, or other kinds of database objects, you should use the Copy Database Wizard instead. For more information, see [Use the Copy Database Wizard](../../relational-databases/databases/use-the-copy-database-wizard.md).  
  
## Static Options  
 **Name**  
 Provide a unique name for the package.  
  
 **Description**  
 Provide a description for the package. As a best practice, describe the package in terms of its purpose, to make packages self-documenting and easier to maintain.  
  
 **Target**  
 View the target ([!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or file) that was previously specified for the destination file.  
  
## Target Dynamic Options  
  
### Target = SQL Server  
 **Server name**  
 When you have selected a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] destination, type or select the destination server name.  
  
 **Use Windows Authentication**  
 When you have selected a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] destination, specify whether to connect to the server by using Windows Integrated Authentication. This is the preferred authentication method.  
  
 **Use SQL Server Authentication**  
 When you have selected a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] destination, specify whether to connect to the server by using SQL Server Authentication.  
  
 **User name**  
 When you have selected a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] destination, and have specified SQL Server Authentication, type the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] user name.  
  
 **Password**  
 When you have selected a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] destination, and have specified SQL Server Authentication, type the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] password.  
  
### Target = File System  
 **File name**  
 When you have selected a file destination, type the path for the destination file, or use the **Browse** button.  
  
 **Browse**  
 When you have selected a file destination, browse to the destination file by using the **Save Package** dialog box.
