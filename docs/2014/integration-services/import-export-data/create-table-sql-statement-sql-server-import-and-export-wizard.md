# Create Table SQL Statement (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
  Use the **Create Table SQL Statement** dialog box to view the statement that was generated automatically, or to modify it for your purposes. If you modify this statement, you may also have to make associated changes to column mapping, and you will have to maintain the edited SQL statement manually thereafter.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] generates a default CREATE TABLE statement based on the connected data source. This default CREATE TABLE statement will not include the FILESTREAM attribute even if the source table includes a column with the FILESTREAM attribute declared. To run an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] component with the FILESTREAM attribute, first implement FILESTREAM storage on the destination database. Then, add the FILESTREAM attribute to the CREATE TABLE statement in the **Create Table** dialog box. For more information, see [Binary Large Object &#40;Blob&#41; Data &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/blob/binary-large-object-blob-data-sql-server.md).  
  
 To learn more about this wizard, see [SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md). To learn about the options for starting the wizard, as well as the permissions required to run the wizard successfully, see [Run the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](start-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).  
  
 The purpose of the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard is to copy data from a source to a destination. The wizard can also create a destination database and destination tables for you. However, if you have to copy multiple databases or tables, or other kinds of database objects, you should use the Copy Database Wizard instead. For more information, see [Use the Copy Database Wizard](../../relational-databases/databases/use-the-copy-database-wizard.md).  
  
## Options  
 **SQL statement**  
 Displays the auto-generated SQL statement and lets it be edited.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to include a carriage return in the SQL statement, press CTRL+ENTER. If you press only ENTER, the dialog box closes.  
  
 **Autogenerate**  
 Restore the default SQL statement, if you have modified it, by clicking **Autogenerate**.
