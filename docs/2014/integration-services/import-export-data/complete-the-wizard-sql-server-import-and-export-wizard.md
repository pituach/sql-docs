# Complete the Wizard (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
  Use the **Complete the Wizard** page to confirm the choices that you have made in the wizard, before copying the data.  
  
 To learn more about this wizard, see [SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md). To learn about the options for starting the wizard, as well as the permissions required to run the wizard successfully, see [Run the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](start-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).  
  
 The purpose of the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard is to copy data from a source to a destination. The wizard can also create a destination database and destination tables for you. However, if you have to copy multiple databases or tables, or other kinds of database objects, you should use the Copy Database Wizard instead. For more information, see [Use the Copy Database Wizard](../../relational-databases/databases/use-the-copy-database-wizard.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Summary of options**  
 View a summary that includes the following information:  
  
-   The source and destinations that the wizard will use.  
  
-   The actions that the wizard will perform, such as what data will be copied, whether the package will be saved, and whether the package will be executed immediately.
