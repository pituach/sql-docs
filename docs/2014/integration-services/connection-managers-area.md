# Connection Managers Area
  Packages use connection managers to connect to data sources such as files, relational databases, and servers.  
  
 Use the **Connections Managers** area of [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer to add, delete, modify, rename, and copy and paste the connection managers.  
  
 Right-click in this area, and then on the menu, click the option for the task you want to perform.
