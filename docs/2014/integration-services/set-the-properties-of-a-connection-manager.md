# Set the Properties of a Connection Manager
  All connection managers can be configured using the **Properties** window.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] also provides custom dialog boxes for modifying the different types of connection managers in [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]. The dialog box has a different set of options depending on the connection manager type.  
  
### To modify a connection manager using the Properties window  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  In SSIS Designer, click the **Control Flow** tab, the **Data Flow** tab, or the **Event Handler** tab to make the **Connection Managers** area available.  
  
4.  Right-click the connection manager and click **Properties**.  
  
5.  In the **Properties** window, edit the property values. The **Properties** window provides access to some properties that are not configurable in the standard editor for a connection manager.  
  
6.  Click **OK**.  
  
7.  To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.
