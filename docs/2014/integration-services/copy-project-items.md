# Copy Project Items
  This topic describes how to copy objects within an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project or between [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] projects. You can also copy objects between the other types of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] projects, [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. To copy between projects, the project must be part of the same [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] solution. For more information, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Projects](integration-services-ssis-projects-and-solutions.md).  
  
### To copy project level items  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project or solution that you want to work with.  
  
2.  Expand the project and item folder to copy from.  
  
3.  Right-click the item and click **Copy**.  
  
4.  Right-click the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project to copy to and click **Paste**.  
  
     The items are automatically copied to the correct folder. If you copy items to the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that are not packages, the items are copied to the **Miscellaneous** folder.
