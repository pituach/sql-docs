# SMTP Connection Manager Editor
  Use the **SMTP Connection Manager Editor** dialog box to specify a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server.  
  
 To learn more about the SMTP connection manager, see [SMTP Connection Manager](connection-manager/smtp-connection-manager.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Name**  
 Provide a unique name for the connection manager.  
  
 **Description**  
 Describe the connection manager. As a best practice, describe the connection manager in terms of its purpose, to make packages self-documenting and easier to maintain.  
  
 **SMTP server**  
 Provide the name of the SMTP server.  
  
 **Use Windows Authentication**  
 Select to send mail using an SMTP server that uses Windows Authentication to authenticate access to the server.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The SMTP connection manager supports only anonymous authentication and Windows Authentication. It does not support basic authentication.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When using Microsoft Exchange as the SMTP server, you may need to set **Use Windows Authentication** to `True`. Exchange servers may be configured to disallow unauthenticated SMTP connections.  
  
 **Enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**  
 Select to encrypt communication using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) when sending e-mail messages.
