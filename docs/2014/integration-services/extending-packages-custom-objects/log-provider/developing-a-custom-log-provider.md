# Developing a Custom Log Provider
  [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] has extensive logging capabilities that make it possible to capture events that occur during package execution. [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] includes a variety of log providers that enable logs to be created and stored in formats such as XML, text, database, or in the Windows event log. If the log providers and the output formats that are provided do not entirely meet your requirements, you can create a custom log provider.  
  
 To create a custom log provider, you have to create a class that inherits from the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.LogProviderBase> base class, apply the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DtsLogProviderAttribute> attribute to your new class, and override the important methods and properties of the base class, including the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.LogProviderBase.ConfigString%2A> property and the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.LogProviderBase.Log%2A> method.  
  
## In This Section  
 This section describes how to create, configure, and code a custom log provider.  
  
 [Creating a Custom Log Provider](creating-a-custom-log-provider.md)  
 Describes how to create the classes for a custom log provider project.  
  
 [Coding a Custom Log Provider](coding-a-custom-log-provider.md)  
 Describes how to implement a custom log provider by overriding the methods and properties of the base class.  
  
 [Developing a User Interface for a Custom Log Provider](developing-a-user-interface-for-a-custom-log-provider.md)  
 Custom user interfaces for custom log providers are not supported in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].
