# Microsoft Connector 1.1 for SAP BW
  The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Connector 1.1 for SAP BW consists of a set of three components that let you extract data from, or load data into, an SAP Netweaver BW version 7 system.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The documentation for the Microsoft Connector 1.1 for SAP BW assumes familiarity with the SAP Netweaver BW environment. For more information about SAP Netweaver BW, or for information about how to configure SAP Netweaver BW objects and processes, see your SAP documentation.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Extracting data from SAP Netweaver BW requires additional SAP licensing. Check with SAP to verify these requirements.  
  
## Components  
 The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Connector 1.1 for SAP BW has the following components:  
  
-   **SAP BW Source**—The SAP BW source is a data flow source component that lets you extract data from an SAP Netweaver BW version 7 system.  
  
-   **SAP BW Destination**—The SAP BW destination is a data flow destination component that lets you load data into an SAP Netweaver BW version 7 system.  
  
-   **SAP BW Connection Manager**—The SAP BW connection manager connects either an SAP BW source or SAP BW destination to an SAP Netweaver BW version 7 system.  
  
 For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to configure and use the SAP BW connection manager, source, and destination, see the white paper, [Using SQL Server Integration Services with SAP BI 7.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301897). This white paper also shows how to configure the required objects in SAP BW.
