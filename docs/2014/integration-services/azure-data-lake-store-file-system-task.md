# Azure Data Lake Store File System Task
The **Azure Data Lake Store File System Task** enables users to perform various file system operations on [Azure Data Lake Store (ADLS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-lake-store/).

To add an Azure Data Lake Store File System Task to a package, drag it from SSIS Toolbox to the designer canvas. Then double-click the task, or right-click the task and select **Edit**, to open the task editor dialog box.

The **Operation** property specifies the file system operation to perform. The following operations are supported.

* **CopyToADLS:** Upload files to ADLS.

For any operation, you have to specify an Azure Data Lake connection manager.

Here are the descriptions of the properties specific to each operation.

## CopyToADLS

* **SearchRecursively:** Specifies whether to search recursively within the source directory for files to upload.
* **AzureDataLakeDirectory:** Specifies the ADLS destination directory to upload files to.
* **FileExpiry:** Specifies an expiration date and time for the files uploaded to ADLS, or leave this property blank to indicate that the files never expire.
