# Grant Permissions to Integration Services Service
  In previous versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], by default when you installed [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] all users in the Users group had access to the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service. When you install the current release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], users do not have access to the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service. The service is secure by default. After [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed, the administrator must grant access to the service.  
  
### To grant access to the Integration Services service  
  
1.  Run Dcomcnfg.exe. Dcomcnfg.exe provides a user interface for modifying certain settings in the registry.  
  
2.  In the **Component Services** dialog, expand the Component Services > Computers > My Computer > DCOM Config node.  
  
3.  Right-click **Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services 12.0**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
4.  On the **Security** tab, click **Edit** in the **Launch and Activation Permissions** area.  
  
5.  Add users and assign appropriate permissions, and then click Ok.  
  
6.  Repeat steps 4 - 5 for Access Permissions.  
  
7.  Restart SQL Server Management Studio.  
  
8.  Restart the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] Service.
