# Set the Properties of a Package
  This procedure describes how to configure package properties by using the **Properties** window.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The package must be opened in SSIS Designer before the Properties window lists the properties you set to configure a package.  
  
### To set package properties  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want to configure.  
  
2.  In **Solution Explorer**, double-click the package to open it in [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer, or right-click and select **View Designer**.  
  
3.  Click the **Control Flow** tab and then do one of the following:  
  
    -   Right-click anywhere in the background of the control flow design surface, and then click **Properties**.  
  
    -   On the **View** menu, click **Properties Window**.  
  
4.  Edit the package properties in the **Properties** window.  
  
5.  On the **File** menu, click **Save Selected Items** to save the updated package.
