##AutoStatsEnabled Switch
Controls the auto statistics feature. This feature switch is set to true by default after upgrading to AU7. Any database created after the upgrade will inherit auto creation and asynchronous update of statistics. For existing databases, database administrators can enable auto statistics with [alter database] (/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-parallel-data-warehouse). For more information on statistics, see [Statistics](../relational-databases/statistics/statistics.md).

##DmsProcessStopMessageTimeoutInSeconds Switch
Controls the time Data Movement Service (DMS) waits to synchronize on a busy system when a query involving data movement is cancelled. Updating to AU7 sets this value to 900 seconds (15 minutes) by default. The valid range is 0 â€“ 3600 seconds.
