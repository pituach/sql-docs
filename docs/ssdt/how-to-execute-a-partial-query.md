# How to: Execute a Partial Query
The Transact\-SQL Editor allows you to highlight a specific segment of the script and execute it as a single query. This makes it easy for you to debug sections of complex queries.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
> The following procedure uses entities created in previous procedures in the [Connected Database Development](../ssdt/connected-database-development.md) and [Project-Oriented Offline Database Development](../ssdt/project-oriented-offline-database-development.md) sections.  
  
### To partially execute a query  
  
1.  In **SQL Server Object Explorer**, double-click **PerishableFruits** under **Views** to open it in Transact\-SQL editor.  
  
2.  Highlight the `SELECT p.Id, p.Name FROM dbo.Product p` segment in the code, right-click and select **Execute Query**.  
  
3.  Notice that all the rows with the specified fields in the `Products` table are returned in the **Results** pane.
