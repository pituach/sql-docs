 The [\[MS-SSAS-T\]: QL Server Analysis Services Tabular (SQL Server Technical Protocol)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=784855) document includes section 3.1.5.2.2 that describes the structure of JSON tabular metadata commands and objects. Currently, that document covers commands and capabilities not yet implemented in TMSL script.
