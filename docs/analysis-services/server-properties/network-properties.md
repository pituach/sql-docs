# Network Properties
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas-all-aas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas-all-aas.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] supports the server properties listed in the following tables. For more information about additional server properties and how to set them, see [Server Properties in Analysis Services](../../analysis-services/server-properties/server-properties-in-analysis-services.md).  
  
 **Applies to:** Multidimensional and Tabular server mode  
  
## General  
 **ListenOnlyOnLocalConnections**  
 A Boolean property that identifies whether to listen only on local connections, for example localhost.  
  
## Listener  
 **IPV4Support**  
 A signed 32-bit integer property that defines support for IPv4 protocol. This property has one of the values listed in the following table:  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|*0*|IPv4 disabled; clients can't connect.|  
|*1*|(Default) IPv4 is required; server won't start if it cannot listen to IPv4.|  
|*2*|IPv4 is optional; server tries to listen to IPv4 but starts even if unable to.|  
  
 **IPV6Support**  
 A signed 32-bit integer property that defines support for IPv6 protocol. This property has one of the values listed in the following table:  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|*0*|IPv6 disabled; clients can't connect.|  
|*1*|(Default) IPv6 is required; server won't start if it cannot listen to IPv6.|  
|*2*|IPv6 is optional; server tries to listen to IPv6 but starts even if unable to.|  
  
 **MaxAllowedRequestSize**  
 An advanced property that you should not change, except under the guidance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.  
  
 **RequestSizeThreshold**  
 An advanced property that you should not change, except under the guidance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.  
  
 **ServerReceiveTimeout**  
 An advanced property that you should not change, except under the guidance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.  
  
 **ServerSendTimeout**  
 An advanced property that you should not change, except under the guidance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.  
  
## Requests  
 **EnableBinaryXML**  
 A Boolean property that specifies whether the server will recognize requests binary xml format.  
  
 **EnableCompression**  
 A Boolean property that specifies whether compression is enabled for requests.  
  
## Responses  
 **CompressionLevel**  
 An advanced property that you should not change, except under the guidance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.  
  
 **EnableBinaryXML**  
 A Boolean property that specifies whether the server is enabled for binary xml responses.  
  
 **EnableCompression**  
 A Boolean property that specifies whether compression is enabled for responses to client requests.  
  
## TCP  
 **InitialConnectTimeout**  
 An advanced property that you should not change, except under the guidance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.
