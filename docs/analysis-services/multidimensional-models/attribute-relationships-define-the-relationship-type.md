# Attribute Relationships - Define the Relationship Type
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  You define the relationship type of an attribute relationship by using the **Attribute Relationships** tab in Dimension Designer, which can be accessed from [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
### To set the relationship type of an attribute relationship  
  
1.  In Dimension Designer, open the dimension with which you want to work, and then click on the **Attribute Relationships** tab.  
  
2.  In the diagram or in the **Attribute Relationships** pane, right-click the attribute relationship, click **Relationship Type**, and then click either **Flexible** or **Rigid**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To display the **Attribute Relationships** pane, click **Show List Views** on the toolbar.  
  
     In a flexible relationship, relationships between members change over time. In a rigid relationship, relationships between members do not change over time.
