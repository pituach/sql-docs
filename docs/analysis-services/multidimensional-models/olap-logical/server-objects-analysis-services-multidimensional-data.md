# Server Objects (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]
    
## Introducing Server Objects  
 The <xref:Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Server> object represents the server and the instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] that you want to work with.  
  
 As soon as you have a connected instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], you will be able to see:  
  
-   All databases that you can access, as a collection.  
  
-   All defined server properties, as a collection.  
  
-   The connection string, the connection information, and the session ID.  
  
-   The product name, edition, and version.  
  
-   The roles collections.  
  
-   The traces collection.  
  
-   The assemblies collection.
