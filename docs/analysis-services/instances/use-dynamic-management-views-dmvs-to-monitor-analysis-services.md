# Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) 

[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas-aas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas-aas.md)]

Analysis Services Dynamic Management Views (DMV) are queries that return information about model objects, server operations, and server health. The query, based on SQL, is an interface to *schema rowsets*. Schema rowsets are predescribed tables that contain information about Analysis Services objects and server state, including database schema, active sessions, connections, commands, and jobs that are executing on the server.

DMV queries are an alternative to running XML/A Discover commands. For most administrators, writing a DMV query is simpler because the syntax is based on SQL. In addition, the result is returned in a table format that is easier to read and copy. 
  
Most DMV queries use a **SELECT** statement and the **$System** schema with an XML/A schema rowset, for example:  
  
```  
SELECT * FROM $System.<schemaRowset>  
```  
  
 DMV queries return information about server and object state at the time the query is run. To monitor operations in real-time, use tracing instead. To learn more about real-time monitoring using traces, see [Use SQL Server Profiler to Monitor Analysis Services](../../analysis-services/instances/use-sql-server-profiler-to-monitor-analysis-services.md).  
  
## Query syntax

The query engine for DMVs is the Data Mining parser. The DMV query syntax is based on the SELECT &#40;DMX&#41; statement. Although DMV query syntax is based on a SQL SELECT statement, it does not support the full syntax of a SELECT statement. Notably, JOIN, GROUP BY, LIKE, CAST, and CONVERT are not supported.  
  
```  
SELECT [DISTINCT] [TOP <n>] <select list>  
FROM $System.<schemaRowset>  
[WHERE <condition expression>]  
[ORDER BY <expression>[DESC|ASC]]  
```  
  
The following example for DISCOVER_CALC_DEPENDENCY illustrates the use of the WHERE clause for supplying a parameter to the query:  
  
```  
SELECT * FROM $System.DISCOVER_CALC_DEPENDENCY  
WHERE OBJECT_TYPE = 'ACTIVE_RELATIONSHIP'  
```  
  
For schema rowsets that have restrictions, the query must include the SYSTEMRESTRICTSCHEMA function. The following example returns CSDL metadata about 1103 compatibility level tabular models. Note that CATALOG_NAME is case-sensitive:  
  
```  
Select * from SYSTEMRESTRICTSCHEMA ($System.Discover_csdl_metadata, [CATALOG_NAME] = 'Adventure Works DW')  
```  

## Examples and scenarios

A DMV query can help you answer questions about active sessions and connections, and which objects are consuming the most CPU or memory at a specific point in time. For example:
  
 `Select * from $System.discover_object_activity`  
This query reports on object activity since the service last started. 
  
 `Select * from $System.discover_object_memory_usage`  
This query reports on memory consumption by object.  
  
 `Select * from $System.discover_sessions`  
This query reports on active sessions, including session user and duration.  
  
 `Select * from $System.discover_locks`   
This query returns a snapshot of the locks used at a specific point in time.  


## Tools and permissions

You can use any client application that supports MDX or DMX queries. In most cases, it's best to use SQL Server Management Studio. You must have server administrator permissions on the instance to query a DMV.  
  
 **To run a DMV query from SQL Server Management Studio**

1. Connect to the server and model object you want to query. 
2. Right-click the server or database object > **New Query** > **MDX**.
3. Type your query, and then click **Execute**, or press F5.
  
## Schema rowsets

Not all schema rowsets have a DMV interface. To return a list of all the schema rowsets that can be queried using DMV, run the following query.  
 
```  
SELECT * FROM $System.DBSchema_Tables   
WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'SCHEMA'   
ORDER BY TABLE_NAME ASC  
```  
  
If a DMV is not available for a given rowset, the server returns error: `The <schemarowset> request type was not recognized by the server.` All other errors indicate problems with the syntax.  

Schema rowsets are described in two SQL Server Analysis Services protocols:   

[[MS-SSAS-T]: SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular Protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt719260) - Describes schema rowsets for tabular models at the 1200 and higher compatibility levels.

[[MS-SSAS]: SQL Server Analysis Services Protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee320606) - Describes schema rowsets for multidimensional models and tabular models at the 1100 and 1103 compatibility levels.
