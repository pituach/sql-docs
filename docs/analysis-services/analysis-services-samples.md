# Analysis Services samples
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas-aas](../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas-aas.md)]

  Use the information here to find sample databases and projects to help you learn about and test your Analysis Services solutions.
  

## Samples on GitHub

[Git repo for Analysis Services](https://github.com/Microsoft/Analysis-Services) includes code samples and community projects.

## Sample solutions and databases  

While no longer officially supported or updated, Adventure Works remains one of the most inclusive and robust sample datasets for learning about and testing Analysis Services. Analysis Services sample projects and databases, as well as examples in documenation, blog posts, and presentations use the Adventure Works 2014 sample data.

[Download Adventure Works sample projects and databases on Codeplex](https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/125550).

A new collection of sample data, Wide World Importers, was introduced for SQL Server 2016. You can use Wide World Importers sample data to learn about and test Analysis Services; however, no tutorials, examples, or documentation are provided. The Wide World Importers dataset and schema do not support many of the features in Analysis Services. To learn more, see [Wide World Importers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt734199).
