# Power Pivot Data Refresh
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  After you create a workbook that contains [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data, you might want to periodically refresh the data by rerunning a query or command to get updated information from the sources you used originally to create the workbook. This process is called **data refresh**, and you can refresh data on demand in [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiClient](../../includes/ssgeminiclient-md.md)], or as a scheduled operation that runs as an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] process on an application server in a SharePoint farm.

> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and SharePoint Server 2013 Excel Services use a different architecture for data refresh of [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data models. The SharePoint 2013 supported architecture utilizes Excel Services as the primary component to load [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data models. The previous data refresh architecture used relied on a server running [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service and [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] in SharePoint mode to load data models.
