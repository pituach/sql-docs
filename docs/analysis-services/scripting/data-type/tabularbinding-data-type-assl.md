# TabularBinding Data Type (ASSL)
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  Defines an abstract derived data type that represents a binding to a tabular item such as a table or a cube dimension.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
  
<TabularBinding>  
   <!-- The TabularBinding element has no child elements other than those inherited from Binding -->  
</TabularBinding>  
```  
  
## Data Type Characteristics  
  
|Characteristic|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|Base data types|[Binding](../../../analysis-services/scripting/data-type/binding-data-type-assl.md)|  
|Derived data types|[DSVTableBinding](../../../analysis-services/scripting/data-type/dsvtablebinding-data-type-assl.md), [QueryBinding](../../../analysis-services/scripting/data-type/querybinding-data-type-assl.md), [TableBinding](../../../analysis-services/scripting/data-type/tablebinding-data-type-assl.md)|  
  
## Data Type Relationships  
  
|Relationship|Element|  
|------------------|-------------|  
|Parent elements|None|  
|Child elements|None|  
|Derived elements|See [Binding](../../../analysis-services/scripting/data-type/binding-data-type-assl.md)|  
  
## Remarks  
 For additional information about the **Binding** type, including tables of Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL) objects of the **Binding** type and the inheritance hierarchy of **Binding** types, see [Binding Data Type &#40;ASSL&#41;](../../../analysis-services/scripting/data-type/binding-data-type-assl.md).  
  
 For an overview of data bindings in ASSL, see [Data Sources and Bindings &#40;SSAS Multidimensional&#41;](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/data-sources-and-bindings-ssas-multidimensional.md).  
  
 The corresponding element in the Analysis Management Objects (AMO) object model is <xref:Microsoft.AnalysisServices.TabularBinding>.
