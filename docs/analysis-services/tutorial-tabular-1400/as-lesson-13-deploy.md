[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sql2017-later-aas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sql2017-later-aas.md)]

In this lesson, you configure deployment properties; specifying a server to deploy to and a name for the model. You then deploy the model to the server. After your model is deployed, users can connect to it by using a reporting client application. To learn more, see [Deploy to Azure Analysis Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-deploy) and [Tabular model solution deployment](../tabular-models/tabular-model-solution-deployment-ssas-tabular.md).  
  
Estimated time to complete this lesson: **5 minutes**  
  
## Prerequisites  

This article is part of a tabular modeling tutorial, which should be completed in order. Before performing the tasks in this lesson, you should have completed the previous lesson: [Lesson 12: Analyze in Excel](../tutorial-tabular-1400/as-lesson-12-analyze-in-excel.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If deploying to Azure Analysis Services, you must have [Administrator permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-server-admins) on the serever.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you installed the AdventureWorksDW sample database on an on-premises SQL Server, and you're deploying your model to an Azure Analysis Services server, an [On-premises data gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-gateway) is required.
  
## Deploy the model  
  
#### To configure deployment properties  

  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **AW Internet Sales** project, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the **AW Internet Sales Property Pages** dialog box, under **Deployment Server**, in the **Server** property, enter the full server name. If connecting to Azure Analysis Services, server name must inlcude the full URL.

3.  In the **Database** property, type **Adventure Works Internet Sales**.  
  
4.  In the **Model Name** property, type **Adventure Works Internet Sales Model**.  
  
5.  Verify your selections and then click **OK**.  
  
#### To deploy the Adventure Works Internet Sales
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **AW Internet Sales** project > **Build**.  

2.  Right-click the **AW Internet Sales** project > **Deploy**.

    When deploying to Azure Analysis Services, you may be prompted to enter your account. Enter your organizational account and password, for example nancy@adventureworks.com. This account must be in Admins on the server.
  
    The Deploy dialog box appears and displays the deployment status of the metadata and each table included in the model.

3. When deployment successfully completes, go ahead and click **Close**.  
  

This lesson describes the most common and easiest method to deploy a tabular model from SSDT. Advanced deployment options such as the Deployment Wizard or automating with XMLA and AMO provide greater flexibility, consistency, and scheduled deployments. To learn more, see [Tabular model solution deployment](../tabular-models/tabular-model-solution-deployment-ssas-tabular.md).

## Conclusion  
Congratulations! You're finished authoring and deploying your first Analysis Services Tabular model. This tutorial has helped guide you through completing the most common tasks in creating a tabular model. Now that your Adventure Works Internet Sales model is deployed, you can use SQL Server Management Studio to manage the model; create process scripts and a backup plan. Users can also now connect to the model using a reporting client application such as Microsoft Excel or Power BI.
