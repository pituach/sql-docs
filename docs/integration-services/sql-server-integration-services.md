# SQL Server Integration Services

[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] is a platform for building enterprise-level data integration and data transformations solutions. Use [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] to solve complex business problems by copying or downloading files, loading data warehouses, cleansing and mining data, and managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] objects and data.

[!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] can extract and transform data from a wide variety of sources such as XML data files, flat files, and relational data sources, and then load the data into one or more destinations.

[!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] includes a rich set of built-in tasks and transformations, graphical tools for building packages, and the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] Catalog database, where you store, run, and manage packages.

You can use the graphical [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] tools to create solutions without writing a single line of code. You can also program the extensive [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] object model to create packages programmatically and code custom tasks and other package objects.
