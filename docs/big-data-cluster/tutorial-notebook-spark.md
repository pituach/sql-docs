# Tutorial: Run a sample notebook on a SQL Server 2019 big data cluster

This tutorial demonstrates how to load and run a notebook in Azure Data Studio on a SQL Server 2019 big data cluster (preview). This allows data scientists and data engineers to run Python, R, or Scala code against the cluster.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer, you can download and run a script for the commands in this tutorial. For instructions, see the [Spark samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/features/sql-big-data-cluster/spark) on GitHub.

## <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

* [Deploy a big data cluster on Kubernetes](deployment-guidance.md).
* [Install Azure Data Studio and the SQL Server 2019 extension](deploy-big-data-tools.md).
* [Load sample data into the cluster](#sampledata).

[!INCLUDE [Load sample data](../includes/big-data-cluster-load-sample-data.md)]

## Download the sample notebook file

Use the following instructions to load the sample notebook file **spark-sql.ipynb** into Azure Data Studio.

1. Open a bash command prompt (Linux) or Windows PowerShell.

1. Navigate to a directory where you want to download the sample notebook file to.

1. Run the following **curl** command to download the notebook file from GitHub:

   ```bash
   curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/master/samples/features/sql-big-data-cluster/spark/spark-sql.ipynb' -o spark-sql.ipynb
   ```

## Open the notebook

The following steps show how to open the notebook file in Azure Data Studio:

1. In Azure Data Studio, connect to the HDFS/Spark gateway of your big data cluster. For more information, see [Connect to the HDFS/Spark gateway](deploy-big-data-tools.md#hdfs).

1. Double-click on the HDFS/Spark gateway connection in the **Servers** window. Then select **Open Notebook**.

1. Wait for the **Kernel** and the target context (**Attach to**) to be populated. Set the **Kernel** to **PySpark3**, and set **Attach to** to the IP address of your big data cluster endpoint.

## Run the notebook cells

You can run each notebook cell by pressing the play button to the left of the cell. The results are shown in the notebook after the cell finishes running.

Run each of the cells in the sample notebook in succession. For more information about using notebooks with SQL Server big data clusters, see the following resources:
