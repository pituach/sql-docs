# SQL Server Agent Properties (Job System Page)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

Use this page to view and modify how the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent Service manages jobs.  
  
## Options  
**Shutdown time-out interval (in seconds)**  
Specifies the number of seconds that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent waits for jobs to complete before shutting down. If the job is still running after the interval specified, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent forcefully stops the job.  
  
**Use a non-administrator proxy account**  
Sets a non-administrator proxy account for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai_md.md)] and later versions support multiple proxies, therefore this option is only applicable when managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent versions prior to [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai_md.md)].  
  
**User name**  
Type the name of the user for the non-administrator proxy account. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] supports multiple proxies, therefore this option is only applicable when managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent versions prior to [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai_md.md)].  
  
**Password**  
Type the password of the user for the non-administrator proxy account. [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005_md.md)] and later versions support multiple proxies, therefore this option is only applicable when managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent versions prior to [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005_md.md)].  
  
**Domain**  
Type the domain of the user for the non-administrative proxy account. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] supports multiple proxies, therefore this option is only applicable when managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent versions prior to [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai_md.md)].
