# Tune Automated Administration Across an Enterprise
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

Multiserver administration with Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent takes advantage of the self-tuning features of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Therefore, under normal conditions, additional job tuning is not necessary. However, network loads increase when you run jobs, generate alerts, and notify operators. You can tune automated administration across an enterprise to minimize the network traffic these activities cause.
