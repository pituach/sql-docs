> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

Use this dialog to pick an existing schedule for the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent job.  
  
## Options  
**Available schedules**

**Name**  
Displays the name of the schedule.  
  
**Enabled**  
Selected if the schedule is enabled.  
  
**Description**  
Describes the conditions under which the schedule runs the job.  
  
**Jobs in schedule**  
Lists the job numbers attached to the schedule. Click a number to view the properties of the job.  
  
**Properties**  
Launches the **Job Schedule Properties** dialog where you can view information about the schedule.
