# Delete Jobs
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

A job is a specified series of operations performed sequentially by SQL Server Agent. By default, jobs are not deleted when execution finishes. You can delete one or more [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent jobs regardless of success or failure of the job. You can also configure [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent to automatically delete jobs when they succeed, fail, or complete.  
  
By default, members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can execute the [sp_delete_job (Transact-SQL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b85db6e4-623c-41f1-9643-07e5ea38db09) system stored procedure to delete a job. Other users must be granted one of the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent fixed database roles in the **msdb** database:  
  
-   **SQLAgentUserRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentReaderRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentOperatorRole**  
  
For details about the permissions of these roles, see [SQL Server Agent Fixed Database Roles](../../ssms/agent/sql-server-agent-fixed-database-roles.md).  
  
Members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can execute **sp_delete_job** to delete any job. A user that is not a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can only delete jobs owned by that user.
