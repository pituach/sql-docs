# Job Properties - New Job (Schedules Page)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

Use this page to view and organize schedules for a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent job.  
  
## Options  
**Schedule list**  
Lists the schedules for this job.  
  
**New**  
Create a new schedule. After you create the schedule, the schedule is added to the job.  
  
**Pick**  
Select a schedule from the existing schedules. Because a job and schedule must have the same owner, this option will only allow you to pick from schedules that you own.  
  
**Edit**  
Edit the selected schedule to change job schedule properties.  
  
**Remove**  
Remove the selected schedule from the job. If no other jobs use the schedule, the schedule is deleted from the database.
