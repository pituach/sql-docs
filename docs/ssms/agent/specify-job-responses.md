# Specify Job Responses
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

Job responses specify actions that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent service will take after a job completes. Job responses ensure that database administrators know when jobs complete and how frequently they run. Typical job responses include:  
  
-   Notifying the operator by using e-mail, electronic paging, or a **net send** message.  
  
    Use one of these job responses if the operator must perform a follow-up action. For example, if a backup job completes successfully, the operator must be notified to remove the backup tape and store it in a safe location.  
  
-   Writing an event message to the Windows application log.  
  
    You can use this response only for failed jobs.  
  
-   Automatically deleting the job.  
  
    Use this job response if you are certain that you do not need to rerun this job.
