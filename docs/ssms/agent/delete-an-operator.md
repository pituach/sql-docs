# Delete an Operator
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to remove an operator so they no longer receive [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent alert notifications in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql_md.md)].

Members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can delete operators.  
  
## <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a>Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To delete an operator  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, click the plus sign to expand the server that contains the operator you want to delete.  
  
2.  Click the plus sign to expand **SQL Server Agent**.  
  
3.  Click the plus sign to expand the **Operators** folder.  
  
4.  Right-click the operator that you want to delete and select **Delete**.  
  
5.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, make sure that the correct operator is selected, and then click **OK**. If you want another operator to receive the alerts and jobs sent to the deleted operator, check **Reassign to** and select an operator in the list.  
  
## <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a>Using Transact-SQL

    ```  
    -- deletes operator 'Test Operator' and reassigns all alerts and jobs
    --  sent to that operator to 'François Ajenstat'  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC sp_delete_operator @name = 'Test Operator',  
        @reassign_to_operator = 'François Ajenstat';  
    GO  
    ```
