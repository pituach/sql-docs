# Defect Multiple Target Servers from a Master Server
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to defect multiple target servers from a multiserver administration configuration in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)]. Run this procedure from the master server.  
  
## <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a>Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To defect multiple target servers from a master server  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, expand a server that is configured as a master server.  
  
2.  Right-click **SQL Server Agent**, point to **Multi Server Administration**, and then click **Manage Target Servers**.  
  
3.  Click **Post Instructions**, and then in the **Instruction type** list, select **Defect**.  
  
4.  Under **Recipients**, do one of the following:  
  
    -   Click **All target servers** to defect all target servers of this master server. Use this option if you want to completely uninstall the current multiserver administration configuration.  
  
    -   Click **These target servers**, and then click the corresponding **Select** box, to defect some, but not all, target servers of this master server.
