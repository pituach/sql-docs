# Designate a Fail-Safe Operator
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

A fail-safe operator is a user who receives the alert if the designated operator cannot be reached. This topic describes how to set a fail-safe operator to receive [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent alert notifications in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)].

### <a name="Restrictions"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   The Pager and **net send** options will be removed from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent in a future version of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)]. Avoid using these features in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use these features.  
  
-   Note that SQL Server Agent must be configured to use Database Mail to send e-mail and pager notifications to operators. For more information, see [Assign Alerts to an Operator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms190038.aspx).  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)] provides an easy, graphical way to manage jobs, and is the recommended way to create and manage the job infrastructure.

Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can designate fail-safe operators.  
  
## <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a>Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To designate a fail-safe operator  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** click the plus sign to expand the server that contains the SQL Server Agent operator that you want to designate as a fail-safe.  
  
2.  Right-click **SQL Server Agent** and select **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **SQL Server Agent Properties –***server_name* dialog box, under **Select a page**, select **Alert System**.  
  
4.  Under **Fail-safe operator**, select **Enable fail-safe operator**.  
  
5.  In the **Operator** list, select the operator that you want to make a fail-safe.  
  
6.  Select either any or all of the following check boxes to specify how the operator will be notified: **E-mail**, **Pager**, or **Net send**.  
  
7.  When finished, click **OK**.
