## Updated Articles with Excerpts

This section displays the excerpts of updates gathered from articles that have recently experienced a large update.

The excerpts displayed here appear separated from their proper semantic context. Also, sometimes an excerpt is separated from important markdown syntax that surrounds it in the actual article. Therefore these excerpts are for general guidance only. The excerpts only enable you to know whether your interests warrant taking the time to click and visit the actual article.

For these and other reasons, do not copy code from these excerpts, and do not take as exact truth any text excerpt. Instead, visit the actual article.

Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (preview) is a new flavor of Azure SQL Database, providing near 100% compatibility with SQL Server on-premises, a native [virtual network (VNet)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) implementation that addresses common security concerns, and a [business model](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/) favorable for on-premises SQL Server customers.
- Support for common management scenarios like:
   - Create and alter databases.
   - Backup and restore databases.
   - Importing, exporting, extracting and publishing Data-tier Applications.
   - Viewing and altering Server properties.
   - Full Object Explorer support.
   - Scripting database objects.
   - Support for SQL Agent jobs.
   - Support for Linked Servers.
- Learn more about Managed Instances [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/migrate-your-databases-to-a-fully-managed-service-with-azure-sql-database-managed-instance/).

Object Explorer:
- Added settings to not force brackets around names when dragging & dropping from Object Explorer to Query Window. (User suggestions [32911933](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32911933), and [32671051](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32671051).)
