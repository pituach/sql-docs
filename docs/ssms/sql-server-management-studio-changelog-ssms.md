# SQL Server Management Studio - Changelog (SSMS)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
This article provides details about updates, improvements, and bug fixes for the current and previous versions of SSMS. Download [previous SSMS versions below](#previous-ssms-releases).


## [SSMS 18.0 (preview 4)](download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md)

Build number: 15.0.18040.0<br>
Release date: September 24, 2018

Preview 4 is the first public preview of SSMS 18.0. For the latest General Availability (GA) version of SSMS, [download and install SSMS 17.9](#ssms-179-latest-ga-release).

### What's new

**General SSMS**

Smaller Download Size:

- The current size of the bundle is less than half of what SSMS 17.x is (~400MB). The size will eventually grow when the Integration Services (IS) components are added back in, but it should not be as big as it used to be.

SSMS 18.x is based on the new Visual Studio 2017 Isolated Shell:

- This means a modern shell (we picked up Visual Studio 2017 15.6.4). The new shell unlocks all the accessibility fixes that went in to both SSMS and Visual Studio.

Accessibility improvements:

- A lot of work went in to address accessibility issues in all the tools (SSMS, DTA, and Profiler).

SSMS can be installed in a custom folder:

- Currently, this is only available on the command-line setup. Pass this extra argument to SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe:

  `SSMSInstallRoot=C:\MySSMS18`

  By default, the new install location for SSMS is: `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18\Common7\IDE\ssms.exe`
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > This does not mean that SSMS is multi-instance.

SSMS no longer shares components with SQL Engine:

- A lot of effort went in to avoid sharing components with SQL Engine, which often resulted in serviceability issues from SQL or SSMS installs overwriting files installed by the other.

SSMS now requires NetFx 4.7.2 or greater:

- We upgraded our minimum requirement from NetFx4.6.1 to NetFx4.7.2: this allows us to take advantage of the new functionality exposed by the new framework.

SSMS is not supported on Windows 8. Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016 requires version 1607 (10.0.14393) or later:
  
- Due to the new dependency on NetFx 4.7.2, SSMS 18.0 does not install on Windows 8, older versions of Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016. SSMS setup will block on those operating systems. Windows 8.1 is still supported.

SSMS is not added to the PATH environment variable:

- Path to SSMS.EXE (and tools in general) is not added to the path anymore. The users can either add it themselves or, if on a modern Windows, rely on the Start menu.

Support for [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](..\includes\sssqlv15-md.md)]

- This is the first release of SSMS that is fully *aware* of [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](..\includes\sssqlv15-md.md)] (compatLevel 150, etc…).
- Support "BATCH_STARTED_GROUP" and "BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP" in [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](..\includes\sssqlv15-md.md)] and SQL Database Managed Instance in SSMS.
- GraphDB: Add flag in showplan for Graph TC Sequence.
- Always Encrypted: Added support for [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves.md).
  - Connection dialog has a new "Always Encrypted" tab when the user clicks on the "Options" button to enable and configure enclave support.

Package IDs no longer needed to develop SSMS Extensions:

- SSMS was selectively loading only well-known packages, requiring developers to register their own packages. This is no longer the case.

Better Azure SQL support:

- SLO/Edition/MaxSize database properties now accept custom names, making it easier to support future editions of Azure SQL Database.
- Added support for vCore SKUs (General Purpose and Business Critical): Gen4_24 and all the Gen5.

SMO:

- Extend SMO Support for Resumable Index Creation.
- Added new event on SMO objects ("PropertyMissing") to help application authors to detect SMO performance issues sooner.
- Exposed new *DefaultBackupChecksum* property on the Configuration object which maps to the "backup checksum default" server configuration.

SSMS:

- Exposing AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES config option  for Filegroups in SSMS
- Removed risky 'lightweight pooling' and 'priority boost' options from SSMS GUI (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/arvindsh/2010/01/26/priority-boost-details-and-why-its-not-recommended).
- SQL Editor honors the **CTRL+D** shortcut to duplicate lines (https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32896594).
- New menu and key bindings to creates files: **CTRL+ALT+N**. **CTRL+N** will continue to create a new query.
- **New Firewall Rule** dialog now allows the user to specify a rule name, instead of automatically generating one (https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32902039).
- Data Classification: updated the recommendations.
- Improved intellisense in Editor especially for v140 T-SQL.
- Support for all Tier-1 languages.
- Added support in SSMS UI for UTF-8 on collation dialog.
- Switched to "Windows Credential Manager" for connection dialog MRU passwords. This will address a long outstanding issue where persistence of passwords was not always reliable (https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32896486).
- Support for High DPI is enabled by default.
- Improved support for multi-monitor systems by making sure that more and more dialogs and windows pop up on the expected monitor.
- Exposed the 'backup checksum default' server configuration in the new Database Settings page of the Server Properties Dialog. (https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/34634974).


SSMS / ShowPlan:

- Added actual time elapsed, actual vs estimated rows under ShowPlan operator node if they are available. This will make actual plan look consistent with Live Query Stats plan.
- Modified tooltip and added comment when clicking on Edit Query Button for a ShowPlan, to indicate to user that the ShowPlan might be truncated by the SQL engine if the query is over 4000 characters.
- Added logic to display the "Materializer Operator (External Select)".
- Add new showplan attribute BatchModeOnRowStoreUsed to easily identify queries that are using the "batch-mode scan on rowstores" feature. Anytime a query performs batch-mode scan on rowstores, a new attribute (BatchModeOnRowStoreUsed="true") gets added to StmtSimple element.

Always On:

- Rehash RTO (estimated recovery time) and RPO (estimated data loss) in SSMS Always on Dashboard. For details, see [Monitor performance for Always On Availability Groups](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/monitor-performance-for-always-on-availability-groups.md).

Audit Files:

- Changed authentication method from Storage Account Key based to Azure AD-based authentication.
AD base
Always Encrypted:

- Added an Always Encrypted tab with an *Enable Always Encrypted* checkbox (in the *Connect to Server* dialog) that now provides an easy way to enable/disable Always Encrypted for a database connection.
- Several enhancements have been made to support Always Encrypted with secure enclaves:
  - A text field for specifying enclave attestation URL in the Connect to Server dialog (the new Always Encrypted tab).
  - The new checkbox in the New Column Master Key dialog to control whether a new column master key allows enclave computations.
  - Other Always Encrypted key management dialogs now expose the information on which column master keys allow enclave computations.
  - For details, see [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves.md).

### Deprecated Features

The following features are no longer available in SSMS:

- T-SQL Debugger
- Database Diagrams
- OSQL.EXE
- Dreplay Admin UI
- Configuration Manager tools:
  - Both SQL Server  Configuration Manager and Reporting Server Configuration Manager are not part of SSMS setup anymore.

- DMF Standard Policies
  - The policies are not installed with SSMS anymore. They will be moved to Git. Users will be able to contribute and download/install them, if they want to.

- SSMS command line option -P removed
  - Due to security concerns, the option to specify clear-text passwords on the command line was removed.

- Generate Scripts | Publish to Web Service removed. This (deprecated) feature was removed from the SSMS UI.

- Removed node "Maintenance | Legacy" in Object Explorer. In Generate and Publish Scripts | Publish to Web Service option is removed.

### Known issues

The following are known issues in the current release:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using *Active Directory – Universal with MFA Support* authentication with the SQL query editor, users may experience their connection being closed and reopened with each query invocation. Side effects of such closure include global temporary tables being dropped unexpectedly and sometimes a new SPID being given to the connection. This closure will not occur if there is an open transaction on the connection. To work around this issue, users can set `persist security info=true` in the connection parameters.

SSMS

- Double-clicking on a .sql file launches SSMS, but does not open the actual script.
  - Workaround: drag and drop the .sql file onto the SSMS editor.

SSIS

- Package can’t be deployed or executed successfully when it targets SQL Server of old version and contains Script Task/Script component at the same time.
- SSMS can’t connect to remote Integration Services.

### What's new

**General SSMS**


ShowPlan:

- Graphical Showplan now shows the new row mode memory grant feedback attributes when the feature is activated for a specific plan: IsMemoryGrantFeedbackAdjusted and LastRequestedMemory added to the MemoryGrantInfo query plan XML element. For more on row mode memory grant feedback, see [Adaptive query processing in SQL databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/adaptive-query-processing).

Azure SQL: 

- Added support for vCore SKUs in Azure DB creation. For more information, see [vCore-based purchasing model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tiers#vcore-based-purchasing-model).
 

### Bug fixes

**General SSMS**
	
Replication Monitor:

- Fixed an issue that was causing Replication Monitor (SqlMonitor.exe) not to start (User Voice item: https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/34791079) 

Import Flat File Wizard: 

- Fixed the link to the help page for "Flat File Wizard" dialog 
- Fixed issue where the wizard did not allow changing the destination table when the table already existed: this allows users to retry without having to exit the wizard, delete the failed table, and then reenter the information into the wizard (User Voice item: https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32896186). 

Import/Export Data-Tier Application:

- Fixed an issue (in DacFx) which was causing the import of a .bacpac could fail with a message like "Error SQL72014: .Net SqlClient Data Provider: Msg 9108, Level 16, State 10, Line 1 This type of statistics is not supported to be incremental. " when dealing with tables with partitions defined and no indexes on the table.

Intellisense:

- Fixed an issue where intellisense completion was not working when using AAD with MFA. 

Object Explorer: 

- Fixed an issue where the "Filter Dialog" was displayed on random monitors instead of the monitor where SSMS was running (multi-monitor systems).

Azure SQL: 

- Fixed an issue related to enumeration of databases in the "Available Databases" where "master" was not displayed in the dropdown when connected to a specific database. 
- Fixed an issue where trying to generate a script ("Data" or "Schema and Data") was failing then connected to the SQL Azure DB using AAD with MFA. 
- Fixed an issue in the View Designer (Views) where it was not possible to select "Add Tables" from the UI when connected to a SQL Azure DB. 
- Fixed an issue where SSMS Query Editor was silently closing and reopening connections during MFA token renewal. This will prevent side effects unbeknownst to the user (like closing a transaction and never reopening again) from happening. The change adds the token expiration time to the properties window. 
- Fixed an issue where SSMS was not enforcing password prompts for imported MSA accounts for AAD with MFA login. 

Activity Monitor: 

- Fixed an issue that was causing "Live Query Statistics" to hang when launched from Activity Monitor and SQL Authentication was used. 

Microsoft Azure integration: 

- Fixed an issue where SSMS only shows the first 50 subscriptions (Always Encrypted dialogs, Backup/Restore from URL dialogs, etc…). 
- Fixed an issue where SSMS was throwing an exception ("Index out of range") while trying to sign in to an Microsoft Azure account which did not have any storage account (in Restore Backup from URL dialog). 

Object Scripting: 

- When scripting "Drop and Create", SSMS now avoids generating dynamic T-SQL.
- When scripting a database object, SSMS now does not generate script to set database scoped configurations, if they are set to default values.

Help:

- Fixed a long outstanding issue where "Help on Help" was not honoring the online/offline mode.
- When clicking on "Help | Community Projects and Samples" SSMS now opens the default browser that points to a Git page and shows no errors/warnings due to old browser being used.

### Known issues

## ![download](../ssdt/media/download.png) [SSMS 17.8.1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802)
*A bug was discovered in 17.8 related to provisioning SQL databases, so SSMS 17.8.1 replaces 17.8.*

Build number: 14.0.17277.0<br>
Release date: June 26, 2018

[Chinese (Simplified)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x804) | [Chinese (Traditional)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x404) | [English (United States)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x409) | [French](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x40c) | [German](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x407) | [Italian](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x410) | [Japanese](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x411) | [Korean](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x412) | [Portuguese (Brazil)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x416) | [Russian](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x419) | [Spanish](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x40a)


### What's new

**General SSMS**

Database Properties:

- This improvement exposes the **AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES** configuration option for Filegroups. This new config option is added under the Database Properties > Filegroups window in the form of a new column (Autogrow All Files) of checkboxes for each available Filegroup (except for Filestream and Memory Optimized Filegroups). The user can enable/disable AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES for a particular Filegroup by toggling the corresponding Autogrow_All_Files checkbox. Correspondingly, the **AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES** option is properly scripted when scripting the database for CREATE / generating scripts for the database (SQL2016 and above).
	
SQL Editor:

- Improved experience with Intellisense in Azure SQL Database when the user doesn't have master access.

Scripting:

- General performance improvements, especially over high-latency connections.
	
**Analysis Services (AS)**

- Analysis Services client libraries and data providers updated to the latest version, which added support for the new Azure Government AAD authority (login.microsoftonline.us).



### Bug fixes

**General SSMS**
	
Maintenance Plans:

- Fixed an issue when editing maintenance plans with Sql Authentication where "Notify Operator Task" was failing when using SQL authentication.
	
Scripting:

- Fixed an issue where PostProcess actions in SMO lead to resource exhaustion and SQL login failures
	
SMO:

- Fixed an issue where Table.Alter() fails if adding a column with a default constraint and the table already has data. For details, see [sql server smo generating inline default constraint when adding a column to a table containing data](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32895625).
	
Always Encrypted:

- Fixed an issue (in DacFx) which was causing a lock timeout error when enabling Always Encrypted on a partitioned table
	

**Analysis Services (AS)**

- Fixed an issue that occurred when modifying an OAuth datasource in a Tabular Analysis Services 1400-level compatibility model, which caused the changes in the OAuth tokens to not get updated in the data source.
- Fixed a crash in SSMS that may have occurred when using some invalid data source credentials or editing data sources that didn't support Change Data Source migration in Power Query (for example, Oracle) in Analysis Services Tabular 1400-level compatibility models.


### Known issues

- Clicking the *Script* button after modifying any filegroup property in the *Properties* window, generates two scripts – one script with a *USE <database>* statement, and a second script with a *USE master* statement.  The script with *USE master* is generated in error and should be discarded. Run the script that contains the *USE <database>* statement.
- Some dialogs display an invalid edition error when working with new *General Purpose* or *Business Critical* Azure SQL Database editions.
- Some latency in XEvents viewer may be observed. This is a [known issue in the .Net Framework](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net472/dotnet472-changes.md#sql). Please, consider upgrading to NetFx 4.7.2.




## ![download](../ssdt/media/download.png) [SSMS 17.7](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126)

### What's new

**General SSMS**

Replication Monitor:   
- Replication monitor now supports registering a listener for scenarios where publisher database and/or distributor database is part of Availability Group. You can now monitor replication environments where publisher database and/or distribution database is part of Always On. 
 
Azure SQL Data Warehouse: 
- Add Rejected Row Location support for External Tables in Azure SQL Data Warehouse. 

**Integration Services (IS)**

- Added a scheduling feature for SSIS packages deployed to Azure SQL Database. Unlike SQL Server on premises and SQL Database Managed Instance, which have SQL Server Agent as a first-class job scheduler, SQL Database does not have a built-in scheduler. This new SSMS feature provides a familiar user interface that's similar to SQL Server Agent for scheduling packages deployed to SQL Database. If you're using SQL Database to host the SSIS catalog database, SSISDB, you can use this SSMS feature to generate the Data Factory pipelines, activities, and triggers required to schedule SSIS packages. You can then edit and extend these objects in Data Factory. For more info, see [Schedule SSIS package execution on Azure SQL Database with SSMS](../integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-schedule-packages-ssms.md). To learn more about Azure Data Factory pipelines, activities, and triggers, see [Pipelines and activities in Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities) and [Pipeline execution and triggers in Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers).
- Support for SSIS package scheduling in SQL Agent on SQL Managed instance. It is now possible to create SQL Agent jobs to execute SSIS packages on the managed instance. 

### Bug fixes

**General SSMS**

- Fixed issue where  SSMS crashes then trying to connect to a server, after opting out of sending telemetry.
 
Azure SQL Database: 
- Fixed an issue  where the user was not able to set or change compatibility level (the drop-down from empty). Note: in order to set the compatibility level to 150, the user still needs to use the *Script* button and manually edit the script. 
 
SMO: 
- Exposed Error Log Size setting in SMO. For details, see [Set the Maximum Size of the SQL Server Error Logs](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/33624115).  
- Fix linefeed scripting in SMO on Linux.
- Miscellaneous perf improvement when retrieving rarely used properties.  

Intellisense: 
- Perf improvement: reduced volume of intellisense queries for column data. This is especially beneficial when working on tables with huge number of columns.

### Known issues in this 17.3 release:

**General SSMS**

- The following SSMS functionality is not supported for Azure AD auth using UA with MFA:
   - Database Engine Tuning Advisor is not supported for Azure AD auth; there is a known issue where the error message presented to the user is a bit cryptic "Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory,…" instead of the expected "Database Engine Tuning Advisor does not support Microsoft Azure SQL Database. (DTAClient)".
- Trying to analyze a query in DTA results in an error: "Object must implement IConvertible. (mscorlib)".
- *Regressed Queries* is missing from the Query Store list of reports in Object Explorer.
   - Workaround: Right-click the **Query Store** node and select **View Regressed Queries**.

**Integration Services (IS)**

- The [execution_path] in [catalog].[event_messagea] is not correct for package executions in Scale Out. The [execution_path] starts with “\Package” instead of the object name of the package executable. When viewing the overview report of package executions in SSMS, the link of “Execution Path” in Execution Overview cannot work. The workaround is to click “View Messages” on overview report to check all event messages.

[Chinese (Simplified)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x804) | [Chinese (Traditional)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x404) | [English (United States)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x409) | [French](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x40c) | [German](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x407) | [Italian](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x410) | [Japanese](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x411) | [Korean](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x412) | [Portuguese (Brazil)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x416) | [Russian](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x419) | [Spanish](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854085&clcid=0x40a)

### Enhancements

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  - Multiple-user Azure AD authentication for Universal authentication with Multi-factor authentication (UA with MFA)
  - A new user credential input field was added for Universal Authentication with MFA to support multi-user authentication.
- The connection dialog box now supports the following 5 authentication methods:
  - Windows Authentication
  - SQL Server Authentication
  - Active Directory - Universal with MFA support
  - Active Directory - Password
  - Active Directory - Integrated

- Database export/import for DacFx wizard using Universal Authentication with MFA.
- For API support, see [IUniversalAuthProvider Interface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.sqlserver.dac.iuniversalauthprovider.aspx).
- ADAL managed library used by Azure AD Universal Authentication with MFA was upgraded to 3.13.9 version.
- In addition a new CLI interface was delivered supporting Azure AD admin setting for SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse.

 For more information on the Active Directory authentication methods, see [Universal Authentication with SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse (SSMS support for MFA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-ssms-mfa-authentication) and [Configure Azure SQL Database multi-factor authentication for SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-ssms-mfa-authentication-configure).

- Output window has entries for queries run during expansion of Object Explorer nodes
- Enabled View designer Azure SQL Databases
- The default scripting options for scripting objects from Object Explorer in SSMS have changed:
  - Previously, the default on a new install was to have the generated script target the latest version of SQL Server (currently SQL Server 2017).
  - In SSMS 17.2 a new option has been added: *Match Script Settings to Source*. When set to *True*, the generated script targets the same version, engine type, and engine edition as the server the object being scripted is from.
  - The *Match Script Settings to Source* value is set to *True* by default, so new installs of SSMS will automatically default to always scripting objects to the same target as the original server.
  - When the *Match Script Settings to Source* value is set to *False*, the normal scripting target options will be enabled and function as they did previously.
Additionally, all the scripting options have been moved to their own section - *Version Options*. They are no longer under *General Scripting Options*.

- Added support for National Clouds in "Restore from URL"

   `Msg 0, Level 11, State 0, Line 0
The connection is broken and recovery is not possible. The client driver attempted to recover the connection one or more times and all attempts failed. Increase the value of ConnectRetryCount to increase the number of recovery attempts.`

   Re-running the query should get past the error and succeed.

## Uninstall and reinstall SSMS 17.x

If your SSMS installation is having problems, and a standard uninstall and reinstall doesn't resolve them, you can first try [repairing](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028054/windows-10-repair-or-remove-programs) the Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell. If repairing the Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell doesn't resolve the problem, the following steps have been found to fix many random issues:

1.	Uninstall SSMS the same way you uninstall any application (using *Apps & features*, *Programs and features*, etc. depending on your version of Windows).

2.	Uninstall Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell **from an elevated cmd prompt**:
   
    ```PUSHD "C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\FE948F0DAB52EB8CB5A740A77D8934B9E1A8E301\redist"```

    ```vs_isoshell.exe /Uninstall /Force /PromptRestart```

3.	Uninstall Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable the same way you uninstall any application. Uninstall both x86 and x64 if they're on your computer.

4.	Reinstall Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell **from an elevated cmd prompt**:  

    ```PUSHD "C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\FE948F0DAB52EB8CB5A740A77D8934B9E1A8E301\redist"```  
 
    ```vs_isoshell.exe /PromptRestart```

5.	Reinstall SSMS.

6.	Upgrade to the [latest version of the Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) if you're not currently up to date.
