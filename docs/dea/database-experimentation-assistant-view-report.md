# View analysis reports with Database Experimentation Assistant
After you've [created your analysis report](database-experimentation-assistant-create-report.md), follow the steps in this article to view the report and gain performance insights provided by your A/B test.

## Select a server

Open the tool and select the menu icon on the left side of the screen. Choose **Analysis Reports** next to the checklist icon to open the Analysis Reports window.

From the **Analysis Reports** window, enter a SQL Server name that has an analysis database and select **Connect**.

## View and understand the analysis report

This section walks you through viewing and understanding the report.

### Query categories
Select different slices of the left pie chart to show only the queries that fall under that category.

![Report Pie Slices](./media/database-experimentation-assistant-view-report/dea-view-report-pie-slices.png)

- **Degraded queries**: queries whose performance was better in A than in B.  
- **Errors**: queries that show errors in instance B but not in instance A.  
- **Improved queries**: queries that ran better in instance B than in instance A.  
- **Indeterminate queries**: queries whose performance change was uncertain.  
- **Same**: queries whose performance stayed the same across instances A and B.

### Individual query drilldown
You can select the query template links to see more detailed information about specific queries.

![Query Drilldown](./media/database-experimentation-assistant-view-report/dea-view-report-drilldown.png)

Select a specific query to open that queryâ€™s comparison summary.

![Comparison Summary](./media/database-experimentation-assistant-view-report/dea-view-report-comparison-summary.png)

You can also see the A and B instance the specific query ran on, as well as a template of what the query might look like. Also, a table displays query information specific to instances A and B.

### Error queries
The comparison summary report has an expandable section for **Error Information** and **Query Plan Information**, which shows the errors and plan information for both instances.

Select the error (red) pie to show these types of errors:
- **Existing errors**: errors that were in A
- **New errors**: errors that were shown in B
- **Resolved errors**: errors that were in A but not in B
