# Upload a File or Report in the report server
The web portal of the report server provides an upload feature so that you can add reports and other files to a report server without having to publish those items from a client application. Files that you upload from the file system are stored as items on the report server. The type of file you upload determines how it is stored:  
  
-   .rdl files are stored as paginated reports.  
  
-   All other files, including shared data source (.rds) files, are uploaded as resources. Resources are not processed by a report server, but can be viewed in the web portal if the report server supports the MIME type of the file.  
  
### To upload a file or report  
  
1.  In the web portal, click **Upload**.  
  
4.  Browse to the file you want to upload. You can upload a report definition file, an image, a document, or any file that you want to make available on the report server.  
  
5.  Type a name for the new item. An item name can include spaces, but cannot include the reserved characters: ; ? : @ & = + , $ / * < > |.  
  
6.  If you want to replace an existing item with the new item, select **Overwrite item if it exists**.  
  
7.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../includes/clickok-md.md)]
