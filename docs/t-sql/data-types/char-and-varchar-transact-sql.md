# char and varchar (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

Character data types that are either fixed-length, **char**, or variable-length, **varchar**. Starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)], when a UTF-8 enabled collation is used, these data types store the full range of [Unicode](../../relational-databases/collations/collation-and-unicode-support.md#Unicode_Defn) character data and use the [UTF-8](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) character encoding. If a non-UTF-8 collation is specified, then these data types store only a subset of characters supported by the corresponding code page of that collation.
  
## Arguments  
**char** [ ( *n* ) ]
Fixed-length string data. *n* defines the string length in bytes and must be a value from 1 through 8,000. For single-byte encoding character sets such as *Latin*, the storage size is *n* bytes and the number of characters that can be stored is also *n*. For multibyte encoding character sets, the storage size is still *n* bytes but the number of characters that can be stored may be smaller than *n*. The ISO synonym for **char** is **character**. For more information on character sets, see [Single-Byte and Multibyte Character Sets](/cpp/c-runtime-library/single-byte-and-multibyte-character-sets).

**varchar** [ ( *n* | **max** ) ]
Variable-length string data. *n* defines the string length in bytes and can be a value from 1 through 8,000. **max** indicates that the maximum storage size is 2^31-1 bytes (2 GB). For single-byte encoding character sets such as *Latin*, the storage size is *n* bytes + 2 bytes and the number of characters that can be stored is also *n*. For multibyte encoding character sets, the storage size is still *n* bytes + 2 bytes but the number of characters that can be stored may be smaller than *n*. The ISO synonyms for **varchar** are **charvarying** or **charactervarying**. For more information on character sets, see [Single-Byte and Multibyte Character Sets](/cpp/c-runtime-library/single-byte-and-multibyte-character-sets).

## Remarks  
When *n* is not specified in a data definition or variable declaration statement, the default length is 1. When *n* is not specified when using the CAST and CONVERT functions, the default length is 30.
  
Objects that use **char** or **varchar** are assigned the default collation of the database, unless a specific collation is assigned using the COLLATE clause. The collation controls the code page that is used to store the character data.

Multibyte encodings in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] include:
-	Double-byte character sets (DBCS) for some East Asian languages using code pages 936 and 950 (Chinese), 932 (Japanese), or 949 (Korean).
-	UTF-8 with code page 65001. **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (Starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]))

If you have sites that support multiple languages:
- Starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)], consider using a UTF-8 enabled collation to support Unicode and minimize character conversion issues. 
- If using a lower version of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], consider using the Unicode **nchar** or **nvarchar** data types to minimize character conversion issues.   

If you use **char** or **varchar**, we recommend to:
- Use **char** when the sizes of the column data entries are consistent.  
- Use **varchar** when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably.  
- Use **varchar(max)** when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably, and the string length might exceed 8,000 bytes.  
  
If SET ANSI_PADDING is OFF when either CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE is executed, a **char** column that is defined as NULL is handled as **varchar**.
  
> [!WARNING]
> Each non-null varchar(max) or nvarchar(max) column requires 24 bytes of additional fixed allocation which counts against the 8,060 byte row limit during a sort operation. This can create an implicit limit to the number of non-null varchar(max) or nvarchar(max) columns that can be created in a table.  
No special error is provided when the table is created (beyond the usual warning that the maximum row size exceeds the allowed maximum of 8,060 bytes) or at the time of data insertion. This large row size can cause errors (such as error 512) during some normal operations, such as a clustered index key update, or sorts of the full column set, which users cannot anticipate until performing an operation.
  
##  <a name="_character"></a> Converting Character Data  
When character expressions are converted to a character data type of a different size, values that are too long for the new data type are truncated. The **uniqueidentifier** type is considered a character type for the purposes of conversion from a character expression, and therefore is subject to the truncation rules for converting to a character type. See the Examples section that follows.
  
When a character expression is converted to a character expression of a different data type or size, such as from **char(5)** to **varchar(5)**, or **char(20)** to **char(15)**, the collation of the input value is assigned to the converted value. If a noncharacter expression is converted to a character data type, the default collation of the current database is assigned to the converted value. In either case, you can assign a specific collation by using the [COLLATE](../../t-sql/statements/collations.md) clause.
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Code page translations are supported for **char** and **varchar** data types, but not for **text** data type. As with earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], data loss during code page translations is not reported.  
  
Character expressions that are being converted to an approximate **numeric** data type can include optional exponential notation (a lowercase e or uppercase E followed by an optional plus (+) or minus (-) sign and then a number).
  
Character expressions that are being converted to an exact **numeric** data type must consist of digits, a decimal point, and an optional plus (+) or minus (-). Leading blanks are ignored. Comma separators, such as the thousands separator in 123,456.00, are not allowed in the string.
  
Character expressions being converted to **money** or **smallmoney** data types can also include an optional decimal point and dollar sign ($). Comma separators, as in $123,456.00, are allowed.
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Showing the default value of n when used in variable declaration.  
The following example shows the default value of *n* is 1 for the `char` and `varchar` data types when they are used in variable declaration.
  
```sql
DECLARE @myVariable AS varchar = 'abc';  
DECLARE @myNextVariable AS char = 'abc';  
--The following returns 1  
SELECT DATALENGTH(@myVariable), DATALENGTH(@myNextVariable);  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Showing the default value of n when varchar is used with CAST and CONVERT.  
The following example shows that the default value of *n* is 30 when the `char` or `varchar` data types are used with the `CAST` and `CONVERT` functions.
  
```sql
DECLARE @myVariable AS varchar(40);  
SET @myVariable = 'This string is longer than thirty characters';  
SELECT CAST(@myVariable AS varchar);  
SELECT DATALENGTH(CAST(@myVariable AS varchar)) AS 'VarcharDefaultLength';  
SELECT CONVERT(char, @myVariable);  
SELECT DATALENGTH(CONVERT(char, @myVariable)) AS 'VarcharDefaultLength';  
```  
  
### C. Converting Data for Display Purposes  
The following example converts two columns to character types and applies a style that applies a specific format to the displayed data. A **money** type is converted to character data and style 1 is applied, which displays the values with commas every three digits to the left of the decimal point, and two digits to the right of the decimal point. A **datetime** type is converted to character data and style 3 is applied, which displays the data in the format  dd/mm/yy. In the WHERE clause, a **money** type is cast to a character type to perform a string comparison operation.
  
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT  BusinessEntityID,   
   SalesYTD,   
   CONVERT (varchar(12),SalesYTD,1) AS MoneyDisplayStyle1,   
   GETDATE() AS CurrentDate,   
   CONVERT(varchar(12), GETDATE(), 3) AS DateDisplayStyle3  
FROM Sales.SalesPerson  
WHERE CAST(SalesYTD AS varchar(20) ) LIKE '1%';  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```
BusinessEntityID SalesYTD              DisplayFormat CurrentDate             DisplayDateFormat

```  
  
### D. Converting Uniqueidentifer Data  
The following example converts a `uniqueidentifier` value to a `char` data type.
  
```sql
DECLARE @myid uniqueidentifier = NEWID();  
SELECT CONVERT(char(255), @myid) AS 'char';  
```  
  
The following example demonstrates the truncation of data when the value is too long for the data type being converted to. Because the **uniqueidentifier** type is limited to 36 characters, the characters that exceed that length are truncated.
  
```sql
DECLARE @ID nvarchar(max) = N'0E984725-C51C-4BF4-9960-E1C80E27ABA0wrong';  
SELECT @ID, CONVERT(uniqueidentifier, @ID) AS TruncatedValue;  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```
String                                       TruncatedValue  
-------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------  
0E984725-C51C-4BF4-9960-E1C80E27ABA0wrong    0E984725-C51C-4BF4-9960-E1C80E27ABA0  
  
(1 row(s) affected)  
```
