# COUNT (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

This function returns the number of items found in a group. `COUNT` operates like the [COUNT_BIG](../../t-sql/functions/count-big-transact-sql.md) function. These functions differ only in the data types of their return values. `COUNT` always returns an **int** data type value. `COUNT_BIG` always returns a **bigint** data type value.

## Syntax  
  
```sql
-- Syntax for SQL Server and Azure SQL Database  
  
COUNT ( { [ [ ALL | DISTINCT ] expression ] | * } )   
    [ OVER (   
        [ partition_by_clause ]   
        [ order_by_clause ]   
        [ ROW_or_RANGE_clause ]  
    ) ]  
```  
  
```sql
-- Syntax for Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
-- Aggregation Function Syntax  
COUNT ( { [ [ ALL | DISTINCT ] expression ] | * } )  

-- Analytic Function Syntax  
COUNT ( { expression | * } ) OVER ( [ <partition_by_clause> ] )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
**ALL**  
Applies the aggregate function to all values. ALL serves as the default.
  
DISTINCT  
Specifies that `COUNT` returns the number of unique nonnull values.
  
*expression*  
An [expression](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) of any type, except **image**, **ntext**, or **text**. Note that `COUNT` does not support aggregate functions or subqueries in an expression.
  
\*  
Specifies that `COUNT` should count all rows to determine the total table row count to return. `COUNT(*)` takes no parameters and does not support the use of DISTINCT. `COUNT(*)` does not require an *expression* parameter because by definition, it does not use information about any particular column. `COUNT(*)` returns the number of rows in a specified table, and it preserves duplicate rows. It counts each row separately. This includes rows that contain null values.
  
OVER **(** [ *partition_by_clause* ] [ *order_by_clause* ] [ *ROW_or_RANGE_clause* ] **)**  
The *partition_by_clause* divides the result set produced by the `FROM` clause into partitions to which the `COUNT` function is applied. If not specified, the function treats all rows of the query result set as a single group. The *order_by_clause* determines the logical order of the operation. See [OVER Clause &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/select-over-clause-transact-sql.md) for more information. 

## Return types
 **int**  
  
## Remarks  
COUNT(\*) returns the number of items in a group. This includes NULL values and duplicates.
  
COUNT(ALL *expression*) evaluates *expression* for each row in a group, and returns the number of nonnull values.
  
COUNT(DISTINCT *expression*) evaluates *expression* for each row in a group, and returns the number of unique, nonnull values.
  
For return values exceeding 2^31-1, `COUNT` returns an error. For these cases, use `COUNT_BIG` instead.
  
`COUNT` is a deterministic function when used ***without*** the OVER and ORDER BY clauses. It is nondeterministic when used ***with*** the OVER and ORDER BY clauses. See [Deterministic and Nondeterministic Functions](../../relational-databases/user-defined-functions/deterministic-and-nondeterministic-functions.md) for more information.
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using COUNT and DISTINCT  
This example returns the number of different titles that an [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoFull](../../includes/sssampledbcofull-md.md)] employee can hold.
  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Title)  
FROM HumanResources.Employee;  
GO  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```
-----------
67  
  
(1 row(s) affected)
```
  
### B. Using COUNT(\*)  
This example returns the total number of [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoFull](../../includes/sssampledbcofull-md.md)] employees.
  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)  
FROM HumanResources.Employee;  
GO  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```
-----------
290  
  
(1 row(s) affected)
```
  
### C. Using COUNT(\*) with other aggregates  
This example shows that `COUNT(*)` works with other aggregate functions in the `SELECT` list. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database.
  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(Bonus)  
FROM Sales.SalesPerson  
WHERE SalesQuota > 25000;  
GO  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```
----------- ---------------------
14            3472.1428
  
(1 row(s) affected)
```
  
### D. Using the OVER clause  
This example uses the `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG` and `COUNT` functions with the `OVER` clause, to return aggregated values for each department in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database `HumanResources.Department` table.
  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Name  
       , MIN(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS MinSalary  
       , MAX(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS MaxSalary  
       , AVG(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS AvgSalary  
       ,COUNT(edh.BusinessEntityID) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS EmployeesPerDept  
FROM HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory AS eph  
JOIN HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh  
     ON eph.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID  
JOIN HumanResources.Department AS d  
ON d.DepartmentID = edh.DepartmentID
WHERE edh.EndDate IS NULL  
ORDER BY Name;  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```sql
Name                          MinSalary             MaxSalary             AvgSalary             EmployeesPerDept

## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
  
### E. Using COUNT and DISTINCT  
This example returns the number of different titles that an employee of a specific company can hold.
  
```sql
USE ssawPDW;  
  
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Title)  
FROM dbo.DimEmployee;  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```
-----------
67
```  
  
### F. Using COUNT(\*)  
This example returns the total number of rows in the `dbo.DimEmployee` table.
  
```sql
USE ssawPDW;  
  
SELECT COUNT(*)  
FROM dbo.DimEmployee;  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```
-------------
296
```  
  
### G. Using COUNT(\*) with other aggregates  
This example combines `COUNT(*)` with other aggregate functions in the `SELECT` list. It returns the number of sales representatives with an annual sales quota greater than $500,000, and the average sales quota of those sales representatives.
  
```sql
USE ssawPDW;  
  
SELECT COUNT(EmployeeKey) AS TotalCount, AVG(SalesAmountQuota) AS [Average Sales Quota]  
FROM dbo.FactSalesQuota  
WHERE SalesAmountQuota > 500000 AND CalendarYear = 2001;  
  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```
TotalCount  Average Sales Quota
----------  -------------------
10          683800.0000
```
  
### H. Using COUNT with HAVING  
This example uses `COUNT` with the `HAVING` clause to return the departments of a company, each of which has more than 15 employees.
  
```sql
USE ssawPDW;  
  
SELECT DepartmentName,   
       COUNT(EmployeeKey)AS EmployeesInDept  
FROM dbo.DimEmployee  
GROUP BY DepartmentName  
HAVING COUNT(EmployeeKey) > 15;  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```
DepartmentName  EmployeesInDept
--------------  ---------------
Sales           18
Production      179
```
  
### I. Using COUNT with OVER  
This example uses `COUNT` with the `OVER` clause, to return the number of products contained in each of the specified sales orders.
  
```sql
USE ssawPDW;  
  
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(ProductKey) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber) AS ProductCount  
    ,SalesOrderNumber  
FROM dbo.FactInternetSales  
WHERE SalesOrderNumber IN (N'SO53115',N'SO55981');  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
```
ProductCount   SalesOrderID`
------------   -----------------
3              SO53115
1              SO55981
```
