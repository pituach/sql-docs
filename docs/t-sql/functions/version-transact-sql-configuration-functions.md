> [!NOTE]  
> We are aware of an issue where the product version reported by @@VERSION is incorrect for Azure SQL Database. 
> The version of the SQL Server database engine run by Azure SQL Database is always ahead of the on-premises version of SQL Server, and includes the latest security fixes. This means that the patch level is always on par with or ahead of the on-premises version of SQL Server, and that the latest features available in SQL Server are available in Azure SQL Database.
>
> To programmatically determine the engine edition, use SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition'). This query will return '5' for standalone databases and '8' for managed instances in Azure SQL Database. 
>
> We will update the documentation once this issue is resolved.
