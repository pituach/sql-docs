# DROP EXTERNAL LIBRARY (Transact-SQL)  
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2017-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2017-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Deletes an existing package library. Package libraries are used by supported external runtimes, such as R or Python.

## Syntax

```sql
DROP EXTERNAL LIBRARY library_name
[ AUTHORIZATION owner_name ];
```

### Arguments

**library_name**

Specifies the name of an existing package library.

Libraries are scoped to the user. Library names must be unique within the context of a specific user or owner.

**owner_name**

Specifies the name of the user or role that owns the external library.

Database owners can delete libraries created by other users.

## Permissions

To delete a library requires the privilege ALTER ANY EXTERNAL LIBRARY. By default, any database owner, or the owner of the object, can also delete an external library.

### Return values

An informational message is returned if the statement was successful.

## Remarks

Unlike other `DROP` statements in SQL Server, this statement supports specifying an optional authorization clause. This allows **dbo** or users in the **db_owner** role to drop a package library uploaded by a regular user in the database.

## Examples

Add the custom R package, `customPackage`, to a database:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY customPackage 
FROM (CONTENT = 'C:\temp\customPackage_v1.1.zip')
WITH (LANGUAGE = 'R');
GO
```

Delete the `customPackage` library.

```sql
DROP EXTERNAL LIBRARY customPackage;
```
