# DROP CERTIFICATE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-pdw-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-pdw-md.md)]

  Removes a certificate from the database.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  A backup of the certificate used for database encryption should be retained even if the encryption is no longer enabled on a database. Even though the database is not encrypted anymore, parts of the transaction log may still remain protected, and the certificate may be needed for some operations until the full backup of the database is performed. The certificate is also needed to be able to restore from the backups created at the time the database was encrypted.
