2. On all cluster nodes, create a file to store the SQL Server username and password for the Pacemaker login. The following command creates and populates this file:

   ```bash
   sudo touch /var/opt/mssql/secrets/passwd
   sudo echo '<loginName>' >> /var/opt/mssql/secrets/passwd
   sudo echo '<loginPassword>' >> /var/opt/mssql/secrets/passwd
   sudo chown root:root /var/opt/mssql/secrets/passwd 
   sudo chmod 600 /var/opt/mssql/secrets/passwd    
   ```

3. On all cluster nodes, open the Pacemaker firewall ports. To open these ports with `firewalld`, run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=high-availability
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

   > If you’re using another firewall that doesn’t have a built-in high-availability configuration, the following ports need to be opened for Pacemaker to be able to communicate with other nodes in the cluster
   >
   > * TCP: Ports 2224, 3121, 21064
   > * UDP: Port 5405

1. Install Pacemaker packages on each node.

   ```bash
   sudo yum install pacemaker pcs fence-agents-all resource-agents
   ```

   ​

2. Set the password for the default user that is created when installing Pacemaker and Corosync packages. Use the same password on all nodes. 

   ```bash
   sudo passwd hacluster
   ```

   ​

3. Enable and start `pcsd` service and Pacemaker. This will allow nodes to rejoin the cluster after the reboot. Run the following command on all nodes.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable pcsd
   sudo systemctl start pcsd
   sudo systemctl enable pacemaker
   ```

4. Install the FCI resource agent for SQL Server. Run the following commands on all nodes. 

   ```bash
   sudo yum install mssql-server-ha
   ```
