# Configure a SQL Server container in Kubernetes for high availability

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-linuxonly](../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-linuxonly.md)]

Learn how to configure a SQL Server instance on Kubernetes in Azure Container Service (AKS), with persistent storage for high availability (HA). The solution provides resiliency. If the SQL Server instance fails, Kubernetes automatically re-creates it in a new pod. AKS provides resiliency against a Kubernetes node failure. 

This tutorial demonstrates how to configure a highly available SQL Server instance in containers that use AKS.

## HA solution that uses Kubernetes running in Azure Container Service

Kubernetes 1.6 and later has support for [storage classes](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/), [persistent volume claims](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#persistentvolumeclaims), and the [Azure disk volume type](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/volumes/azure_disk). You can create and manage your SQL Server instances natively in Kubernetes. The example in this article shows how to create a [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) to achieve a high availability configuration similar to a shared disk failover cluster instance. In this configuration, Kubernetes plays the role of the cluster orchestrator. When a SQL Server instance in a container fails, the orchestrator bootstraps another instance of the container that attaches to the same persistent storage.

![Diagram of Kubernetes SQL Server cluster](media/tutorial-sql-server-containers-kubernetes/kubernetes-sql.png)

In the preceding diagram, `mssql-server` is a container in a [pod](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/). Kubernetes orchestrates the resources in the cluster. A [replica set](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) ensures that the pod is automatically recovered after a node failure. Applications connect to the service. In this case, the service represents a load balancer that hosts an IP address that stays the same after failure of the `mssql-server`.

In the following diagram, the `mssql-server` container has failed. As the orchestrator, Kubernetes guarantees the correct count of healthy instances in the replica set, and starts a new container according to the configuration. The orchestrator starts a new pod on the same node, and `mssql-server` reconnects to the same persistent storage. The service connects to the re-created `mssql-server`.

In the following diagram, the node hosting the `mssql-server` container has failed. The orchestrator starts the new pod on a different node, and `mssql-server` reconnects to the same persistent storage. The service connects to the re-created `mssql-server`.

## Prerequisites

* **Kubernetes cluster**
   - The tutorial requires a Kubernetes cluster. The steps use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/) to manage the cluster. 

   - See [Deploy an Azure Container Service (AKS) cluster](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster) to create and connect to a single-node Kubernetes cluster in AKS with `kubectl`. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >To protect against node failure, a Kubernetes cluster requires more than one node.

* **Azure CLI 2.0.23**
   - The instructions in this tutorial have been validated against Azure CLI 2.0.23.

## Create an SA password

Create an SA password in the Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes can manage sensitive configuration information, like passwords as [secrets](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

The following command creates a password for the SA account:

   ```azurecli
   kubectl create secret generic mssql --from-literal=SA_PASSWORD="MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd"
   ```  

   Replace `MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd` with a complex password.

   To create a secret in Kubernetes named `mssql` that holds the value `MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd` for the `SA_PASSWORD`, run the command.


## Create storage

Configure a [persistent volume](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) and [persistent volume claim](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistent-volume-claim-protection) in the Kubernetes cluster. Complete the following steps: 

1. Create a manifest to define the storage class and the persistent volume claim.  The manifest specifies the storage provisioner, parameters, and [reclaim policy](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#reclaiming). The Kubernetes cluster uses this manifest to create the persistent storage. 

   The following yaml example defines a storage class and persistent volume claim. The storage class provisioner is `azure-disk`, because this Kubernetes cluster is in Azure. The storage account type is `Standard_LRS`. The persistent volume claim is named `mssql-data`. The persistent volume claim metadata includes an annotation connecting it back to the storage class. 

   ```yaml
   kind: StorageClass
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
   metadata:
        name: azure-disk
   provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
   parameters:
     storageaccounttype: Standard_LRS
     kind: Managed
   ---
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
     name: mssql-data
     annotations:
       volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: azure-disk
   spec:
     accessModes:
     - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 8Gi
   ```

   Save the file (for example, **pvc.yaml**).

1. Create the persistent volume claim in Kubernetes.

   ```azurecli
   kubectl apply -f <Path to pvc.yaml file>
   ```

   `<Path to pvc.yaml file>` is the location where you saved the file.

   The persistent volume is automatically created as an Azure storage account, and bound to the persistent volume claim. 

    ![Screenshot of persistent volume claim command](media/tutorial-sql-server-containers-kubernetes/02_pvc_cmd.png)

1. Verify the persistent volume claim.

   ```azurecli
   kubectl describe pvc <PersistentVolumeClaim>
   ```

   `<PersistentVolumeClaim>` is the name of the persistent volume claim.

   In the preceding step, the persistent volume claim is named `mssql-data`. To see the metadata about the persistent volume claim, run the following command:

   ```azurecli
   kubectl describe pvc mssql-data
   ```

   The returned metadata includes a value called `Volume`. This value maps to the name of the blob.

   ![Screenshot of returned metadata, including Volume](media/tutorial-sql-server-containers-kubernetes/describe-volume.png)

   The value for volume matches part of the name of the blob in the following image from the Azure portal: 

   ![Screenshot of Azure portal blob name](media/tutorial-sql-server-containers-kubernetes/describe-volume-portal.png)

1. Verify the persistent volume.

   ```azurecli
   kubectl describe pv
   ```

   `kubectl` returns metadata about the persistent volume that was automatically created and bound to the persistent volume claim. 

## Create the deployment

In this example, the container hosting the SQL Server instance is described as a Kubernetes deployment object. The deployment creates a replica set. The replica set creates the pod. 

In this step, create a manifest to describe the container based on the SQL Server [mssql-server-linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux/) Docker image. The manifest references the `mssql-server` persistent volume claim, and the `mssql` secret that you already applied to the Kubernetes cluster. The manifest also describes a [service](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). This service is a load balancer. The load balancer guarantees that the IP address persists after SQL Server instance is recovered. 

1. Create a manifest (a YAML file) to describe the deployment. The following example describes a deployment, including a container based on the SQL Server container image.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: mssql-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: mssql
       spec:
         terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
         containers:
         - name: mssql
           image: microsoft/mssql-server-linux
           ports:
           - containerPort: 1433
           env:
           - name: ACCEPT_EULA
             value: "Y"
           - name: SA_PASSWORD
             valueFrom:
               secretKeyRef:
                 name: mssql
                 key: SA_PASSWORD 
           volumeMounts:
           - name: mssqldb
             mountPath: /var/opt/mssql
         volumes:
         - name: mssqldb
           persistentVolumeClaim:
             claimName: mssql-data
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: mssql-deployment
   spec:
     selector:
       app: mssql
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 1433
         targetPort: 1433
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

   Copy the preceding code into a new file, named `sqldeployment.yaml`. Update the following values: 

   * `value: "Developer"`: Sets the container to run SQL Server Developer edition. Developer edition is not licensed for production data. If the deployment is for production use, set the appropriate edition (`Enterprise`, `Standard`, or `Express`). 

      >[!NOTE]
      >For more information, see [How to license SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-2017-pricing).

   * `persistentVolumeClaim`: This value requires an entry for `claimName:` that maps to the name used for the persistent volume claim. This tutorial uses `mssql-data`. 

   * `name: SA_PASSWORD`: Configures the container image to set the SA password, as defined in this section.

     ```yaml
     valueFrom:
       secretKeyRef:
         name: mssql
         key: SA_PASSWORD 
     ```

     When Kubernetes deploys the container, it refers to the secret named `mssql` to get the value for the password. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >By using the `LoadBalancer` service type, the SQL Server instance is accessible remotely (via the internet) at port 1433.

   Save the file (for example, **sqldeployment.yaml**).

1. Create the deployment.

   ```azurecli
   kubectl apply -f <Path to sqldeployment.yaml file>
   ```

   `<Path to sqldeployment.yaml file>` is the location where you saved the file.

   ![Screenshot of deployment command](media/tutorial-sql-server-containers-kubernetes/04_deploy_cmd.png)

   The deployment and service are created. The SQL Server instance is in a container, connected to persistent storage.

   To view the status of the pod, type `kubectl get pod`.

   ![Screenshot of get pod command](media/tutorial-sql-server-containers-kubernetes/05_get_pod_cmd.png)

   In the preceding image, the pod has a status of `Running`. This status indicates that the container is ready. This may take several minutes.

   >[!NOTE]
   >After the deployment is created, it can take a few minutes before the pod is visible. The delay is because the cluster pulls the [mssql-server-linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux/) image from the Docker hub. After the image is pulled the first time, subsequent deployments might be faster if the deployment is to a node that already has the image cached on it. 

1. Verify the services are running. Run the following command:

   ```azurecli
   kubectl get services 
   ```

   This command returns services that are running, as well as the internal and external IP addresses for the services. Note the external IP address for the `mssql-deployment` service. Use this IP address to connect to SQL Server. 

   ![Screenshot of get service command](media/tutorial-sql-server-containers-kubernetes/06_get_service_cmd.png)

   For more information about the status of the objects in the Kubernetes cluster, run:

   ```azurecli
   az aks browse --resource-group <MyResourceGroup> --name <MyKubernetesClustername>
   ```  

## Connect to the SQL Server instance

If you configured the container as described, you can connect with an application from outside the Azure virtual network. Use the `sa` account and the external IP address for the service. Use the password that you configured as the Kubernetes secret. 

You can use the following applications to connect to the SQL Server instance. 

* [SSMS](http://docs.microsoft.com/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-manage-ssms)

* [SSDT](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-develop-use-ssdt)

* sqlcmd
   
   To connect with `sqlcmd`, run the following command:

   ```cmd
   sqlcmd -S <External IP Address> -U sa -P "MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd"
   ```

   Replace the following values:
      
    - `<External IP Address>` with the IP address for the `mssql-deployment` service 
    - `MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd` with your password

## Verify failure and recovery

To verify failure and recovery, you can delete the pod. Do the following steps:

1. List the pod running SQL Server.

   ```azurecli
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   Note the name of the pod running SQL Server.

1. Delete the pod.

   ```azurecli
   kubectl delete pod mssql-deployment-0
   ```
   `mssql-deployment-0` is the value returned from the previous step for pod name. 

Kubernetes automatically re-creates the pod to recover a SQL Server instance, and connect to the persistent storage. Use `kubectl get pods` to verify that a new pod is deployed. Use `kubectl get services` to verify that the IP address for the new container is the same.
