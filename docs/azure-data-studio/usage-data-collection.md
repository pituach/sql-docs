# Enable or disable usage data collection for [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)]

## How to disable telemetry reporting

[!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services. To learn more, read the [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=528096&clcid=0x409).

If you donâ€™t wish to send usage data to Microsoft, you can set the *telemetry.enableTelemetry* setting to *false*.

To silence all telemetry events from [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)], from **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings**, add the following option:

```json
    "telemetry.enableTelemetry": false
```

**Important Notice**: This option requires a restart of [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] to take effect. 

## How to disable crash reporting

To disable crash reporting, from **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings**, add the following option:

```json
    "telemetry.enableCrashReporter": false
```

**Important Notice**: This option requires a restart of [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] to take effect.
