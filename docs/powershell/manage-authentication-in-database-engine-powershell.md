# Manage Authentication in Database Engine PowerShell
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell components use Windows Authentication when connecting to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)]. You can use SQL Server Authentication by either defining a PowerShell virtual drive, or by specifying the **–Username** and **–Password** parameters for **Invoke-Sqlcmd**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> There are two SQL Server PowerShell modules; **SqlServer** and **SQLPS**. The **SQLPS** module is included with the SQL Server installation (for backwards compatibility), but is no longer being updated. The most up-to-date PowerShell module is the **SqlServer** module. The **SqlServer** module contains updated versions of the cmdlets in **SQLPS**, and also includes new cmdlets to support the latest SQL features.  
> Previous versions of the **SqlServer** module *were* included with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), but only with the 16.x versions of SSMS. To use PowerShell with SSMS 17.0 and later, the **SqlServer** module must be installed from the PowerShell Gallery.
> To install the **SqlServer** module, see [Install SQL Server PowerShell](download-sql-server-ps-module.md).

  
##  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 All actions you can perform in an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] are controlled by the permissions granted to the authentication credentials used to connect to the instance. By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provider and cmdlets use the Windows account under which it is running to make a Windows Authentication connection to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
 To make a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication connection you must supply a SQL Server Authentication login ID and password. When using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provider, you must associate the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login credentials with a virtual drive, and then use the change directory command (**cd**) to connect to that drive. In Windows PowerShell, security credentials can only be associated with virtual drives.  
  
##  <a name="SQLAuthVirtDrv"></a> SQL Server Authentication Using a Virtual Drive  
 **To create a virtual drive associated with a SQL Server Authentication login**  
  
1.  Create a function that:  
  
    1.  Has parameters for the name to give the virtual drive, the login ID, and the provider path to associate with the virtual drive.  
  
    2.  Uses **read-host** to prompt the user for the password.  
  
    3.  Uses **new-object** to create a credentials object.  
  
    4.  Uses **new-psdrive** to create a virtual drive with the supplied credentials.  
  
2.  Invoke the function to create a virtual drive with the supplied credentials.  
  
### Example (Virtual Drive)  
 This example creates a function named **sqldrive** that you can use to create a virtual drive that is associated with the specified [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication login and instance.  
  
 The **sqldrive** function prompts you to enter the password for your login, masking the password as you type it in. Then, whenever you use the change directory command (**cd**) to connect to a path by using the virtual drive name, all operations are performed by using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication login credentials that you supplied when you created the drive.  
  
```  
## Create a function that specifies the login and prompts for the password.  
  
function sqldrive  
{  
    param( [string]$name, [string]$login = "MyLogin", [string]$root = "SQLSERVER:\SQL\MyComputer\MyInstance" )  
    $pwd = read-host -AsSecureString -Prompt "Password"  
    $cred = new-object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist $login,$pwd  
    New-PSDrive $name -PSProvider SqlServer -Root $root -Credential $cred -Scope 1  
}  
  
## Use the sqldrive function to create a SQLAuth virtual drive.  
sqldrive SQLAuth  
  
## CD to the virtual drive, which invokes the supplied authentication credentials.  
cd SQLAuth  
```  
  
##  <a name="SQLAuthInvSqlCmd"></a> SQL Server Authentication Using Invoke-Sqlcmd  
 **To use Invoke-Sqlcmd with SQL Server Authentication**  
  
1.  Use the **–Username** parameter to specify a login ID, and the **–Password** parameter to specify the associated password.  
  
### Example (Invoke-Sqlcmd)  
 This example uses the read-host cmdlet to prompt the user for a password, and then connects using SQL Server Authentication.  
  
```  
## Prompt the user for their password.  
$pwd = read-host -AsSecureString -Prompt "Password"  
  
Invoke-Sqlcmd -Query "SELECT GETDATE() AS TimeOfQuery;" -ServerInstance "MyComputer\MyInstance" –Username “MyLogin” –Password $pwd  
```
