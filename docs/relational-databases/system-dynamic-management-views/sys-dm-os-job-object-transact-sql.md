# sys.dm_os_job_object (Azure SQL Database)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Returns a single row describing the configuration of the job object that manages the SQL Server process, as well as certain resource consumption statistics at the job object level. Returns an empty set if SQL Server is not running in a job object. 

A job object is a Windows construct that implements CPU, memory, and IO resource governance at the operating system level. For more information about job objects, see [Job Objects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms684161.aspx). 

> [!NOTE]
> The sys.dm_os_job_object DMV may currently appear as sys.dm_job_object. This is temporary: `sys.dm_os_job_object` will be the permanent name of this DMV. 
  
|Columns|Data Type|Description|  
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|cpu_rate|**int**|Specifies the portion of processor cycles that the SQL Server threads can use during each scheduling interval. The value is reported as a percentage of available cycles within a 10000-cycle scheduling interval. For example, the value 100 means that threads can use CPU cores are their full capacity.|
|cpu_affinity_mask|**bigint**|A bit mask describing which logical processors the SQL Server process can use within the processor group. For example, cpu_affinity_mask 255 (1111 1111 in binary) means that the first eight logical processors can be used.|
|cpu_affinity_group|**int**|The number of the processor group that is used by SQL Server.|
|memory_limit_mb|**bigint**|The maximum amount of committed memory, in MB, that all processes in the job object, including SQL Server, can use cumulatively.| 
|process_memory_limit_mb |**bigint**|The maximum amount of committed memory, in MB, that a single process in the job object, such as SQL Server, can use.|
|workingset_limit_mb |**bigint**|The maximum amount of memory, in MB, that the SQL Server working set can use.|
|non_sos_mem_gap_mb|**bigint**|The amount of memory, in MB, set aside for thread stacks, DLLs, and other non-SOS memory allocations. SOS target memory is the difference between `process_memory_limit_mb` and `non_sos_mem_gap_mb`.| 
|low_mem_signal_threshold_mb|**bigint**|A memory threshold, in MB. When the amount of available memory for the job object is below this threshold, a low memory notification signal is sent to the SQL Server process. |
|total_user_time|**bigint**|The total number of 100 ns ticks that threads within the job object have spent in user mode, since the job object was created. |
|total_kernel_time |**bigint**|The total number of 100 ns ticks that threads within the job object have spent in kernel mode, since the job object was created. |
|write_operation_count |**bigint**|The total number of write IO operations on local disks issued by SQL Server since the job object was created. |
|read_operation_count |**bigint**|The total number of read IO operations on local disks issued by SQL Server since the job object was created. |
|peak_process_memory_used_mb|**bigint**|The peak amount of memory, in MB, that a single process in the job object, such as SQL Server, has used since the job object was created.| 
|peak_job_memory_used_mb|**bigint**|The peak amount of memory, in MB, that all processes in the job object have used cumulatively since the job object was created.|
  
## Permissions  
On SQL Database Managed Instance, requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission. 
On SQL Database, requires the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission in the database.
