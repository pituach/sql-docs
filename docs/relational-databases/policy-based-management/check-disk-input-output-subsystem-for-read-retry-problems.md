  This rule checks the event log for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error message 825. This message indicates that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] was unable to read data from the disk on the first try. This message indicates a major problem with the disk I/O subsystem. This message does not currently indicate a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] problem.
