## Errors 3000 - 3999
| Error| Severity | Event Logged | Description|
| :------ | :------| :------| :----------------------------- |
|	3002	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot BACKUP or RESTORE a database snapshot.	|
|	3003	|	10	|	No	|	This BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL will be based on more than one file backup. All those file backups must be restored before attempting to restore this differential backup.	|
|	3004	|	16	|	No	|	The primary filegroup cannot be backed up as a file backup because the database is using the SIMPLE recovery model. Consider taking a partial backup by specifying READ_WRITE_FILEGROUPS.	|
|	3005	|	10	|	No	|	The differential partial backup is including a read-only filegroup, '%ls'. This filegroup was read-write when the base partial backup was created, but was later changed to read-only access. We recommend that you create a separate file backup of the '%ls' filegroup now, and then create a new partial backup to provide a new base for later differential partial backups.	|
|	3006	|	16	|	No	|	The differential backup is not allowed because it would be based on more than one base backup. Multi-based differential backups are not allowed in the simple recovery model, and are never allowed for partial differential backups.	|
|	3007	|	16	|	No	|	The backup of the file or filegroup "%ls" is not permitted because it is not online. BACKUP can be performed by using the FILEGROUP or FILE clauses to restrict the selection to include only online data.	|
|	3008	|	16	|	No	|	The specified device type is not supported for backup mirroring.	|
|	3009	|	16	|	No	|	Could not insert a backup or restore history/detail record in the msdb database. This may indicate a problem with the msdb database. The backup/restore operation was still successful.	|
|	3010	|	16	|	No	|	Invalid backup mirror specification. All mirrors must have the same number of members.	|
|	3011	|	16	|	No	|	All backup devices must be of the same general class (for example, DISK and TAPE).	|
|	3012	|	17	|	No	|	VDI ran out of buffer when SQL Server attempted to send differential information to SQL Writer.	|
|	3013	|	16	|	No	|	%hs is terminating abnormally.	|
|	3014	|	10	|	No	|	%hs successfully processed %I64d pages in %d.%03d seconds (%d.%03d MB/sec).	|
|	3015	|	10	|	No	|	%hs is not yet implemented.	|
|	3016	|	16	|	No	|	Backup of file '%ls' is not permitted because it contains pages subject to an online restore sequence. Complete the restore sequence before taking the backup, or restrict the backup to exclude this file.	|
|	3017	|	16	|	No	|	The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' could not be opened. Operating system error '%ls'. Correct the problem, or reissue the command without RESTART.	|
|	3018	|	10	|	No	|	The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' was not found. The RESTORE command will continue from the beginning as if RESTART had not been specified.	|
|	3019	|	16	|	No	|	The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' is from a previous interrupted RESTORE operation and is inconsistent with the current RESTORE command. The restart command must use the same syntax as the interrupted command, with the addition of the RESTART clause. Alternatively, reissue the current statement without the RESTART clause.	|
|	3021	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot perform a backup or restore operation within a transaction.	|
|	3022	|	10	|	No	|	This backup is a file backup of read-write data from a database that uses the simple recovery model. This is only appropriate if you plan to set the filegroup to read-only followed by a differential file backup. Consult Books Online for more information on managing read-only data for the simple recovery model. In particular, consider how partial backups are used.	|
|	3023	|	16	|	No	|	Backup, file manipulation operations (such as ALTER DATABASE ADD FILE) and encryption changes on a database must be serialized. Reissue the statement after the current backup or file manipulation operation is completed.	|
|	3024	|	16	|	No	|	You can only perform a full backup of the master database. Use BACKUP DATABASE to back up the entire master database.	|
|	3025	|	16	|	No	|	Missing database name. Reissue the statement specifying a valid database name.	|
|	3027	|	16	|	No	|	The filegroup "%.*ls" is not part of database "%.*ls".	|
|	3028	|	10	|	No	|	The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' was corrupted and is being ignored. The RESTORE command will continue from the beginning as if RESTART had not been specified.	|
|	3031	|	16	|	No	|	Option '%ls' conflicts with option(s) '%ls'. Remove the conflicting option and reissue the statement.	|
|	3032	|	16	|	No	|	One or more of the options (%ls) are not supported for this statement. Review the documentation for supported options.	|
|	3033	|	16	|	No	|	BACKUP DATABASE cannot be used on a database opened in emergency mode.	|
|	3034	|	16	|	No	|	No files were selected to be processed. You may have selected one or more filegroups that have no members.	|
|	3035	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot perform a differential backup for database "%ls", because a current database backup does not exist. Perform a full database backup by reissuing BACKUP DATABASE, omitting the WITH DIFFERENTIAL option.	|
|	3036	|	16	|	No	|	The database "%ls" is in warm-standby state (set by executing RESTORE WITH STANDBY) and cannot be backed up until the entire restore sequence is completed.	|
|	3038	|	16	|	No	|	The file name "%ls" is invalid as a backup device name. Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid file name.	|
|	3039	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot perform a differential backup for file '%ls' because a current file backup does not exist. Reissue BACKUP DATABASE omitting the WITH DIFFERENTIAL option.	|
|	3040	|	10	|	No	|	An error occurred while informing replication of the backup. The backup will continue, but the replication environment should be inspected.	|
|	3041	|	16	|	Yes	|	BACKUP failed to complete the command %.*ls. Check the backup application log for detailed messages.	|
|	3042	|	10	|	No	|	BACKUP WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR successfully generated a backup of the damaged database. Refer to the SQL Server error log for information about the errors that were encountered.	|
|	3043	|	16	|	No	|	BACKUP '%ls' detected an error on page (%d:%d) in file '%ls'.	|
|	3044	|	16	|	No	|	Invalid zero-length device name. Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid device name.	|
|	3045	|	16	|	No	|	BACKUP or RESTORE requires the NTFS file system for FILESTREAM and full-text support. The path "%.*ls" is not usable.	|
|	3046	|	16	|	No	|	Inconsistent metadata has been encountered. The only possible backup operation is a tail-log backup using the WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR or NO_TRUNCATE option.	|
|	3047	|	16	|	No	|	The BackupDirectory registry key is not configured correctly. This key should specify the root path where disk backup files are stored when full path names are not provided. This path is also used to locate restart checkpoint files for RESTORE.	|
|	3049	|	16	|	No	|	BACKUP detected corruption in the database log. Check the errorlog for more information.	|
|	3050	|	16	|	No	|	SQL Server could not send the differential information for database file '%ls' of database '%ls\\%ls' to the backup application because the differential information is too large to fit in memory, and an attempt to use a temporary file has failed.	|
|	3051	|	16	|	No	|	BACKUP LOG was unable to maintain mirroring consistency for database '%ls'. Database mirroring has been suspended.	|
|	3054	|	16	|	No	|	Differential file backups can include only read-only data for databases using the simple recovery model. Consider taking a partial backup by specifying READ_WRITE_FILEGROUPS.	|
|	3055	|	16	|	No	|	Backup destination "%.*ls" supports a FILESTREAM filegroup. This filegroup cannot be used as a backup destination. Rerun the BACKUP statement with a valid backup destination.	|
|	3056	|	16	|	No	|	The backup operation has detected an unexpected file in a FILESTREAM container. The backup operation will continue and include file '%ls'.	|
|	3057	|	16	|	No	|	Invalid device name. The length of the device name provided exceeds supported limit (maximum length is:%d). Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid device name.	|
|	3058	|	10	|	No	|	File or device name exceeds the supported limit (maximum length is:%d) and will be truncated: %.*ls.	|
|	3098	|	16	|	No	|	The backup cannot be performed because '%ls' was requested after the media was formatted with an incompatible structure. To append to this media set, either omit '%ls' or specify '%ls'. Alternatively, you can create a new media set by using WITH FORMAT in your BACKUP statement. If you use WITH FORMAT on an existing media set, all its backup sets will be overwritten.	|
|	3101	|	16	|	No	|	Exclusive access could not be obtained because the database is in use.	|
|	3102	|	16	|	No	|	%ls cannot process database '%ls' because it is in use by this session. It is recommended that the master database be used when performing this operation.	|
|	3103	|	16	|	No	|	A partial restore sequence cannot be initiated by this command. To initiate a partial restore sequence, use the WITH PARTIAL clause of the RESTORE statement and provide a backup set which includes a full copy of at least the primary data file. The WITH PARTIAL clause of the RESTORE statement may not be used for any other purpose.	|
|	3104	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE cannot operate on database '%ls' because it is configured for database mirroring. Use ALTER DATABASE to remove mirroring if you intend to restore the database.	|
|	3105	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE cannot restore any more pages into file '%ls' because the maximum number of pages (%d) are already being restored. Either complete the restore sequence for the existing pages, or use RESTORE FILE to restore all pages in the file.	|
|	3106	|	16	|	No	|	The filegroup "%ls" is ambiguous. The identity in the backup set does not match the filegroup that is currently defined in the online database. To force the use of the filegroup in the backup set, take the database offline and then reissue the RESTORE command.	|
|	3107	|	16	|	No	|	The file "%ls" is ambiguous. The identity in the backup set does not match the file that is currently defined in the online database. To force the use of the file in the backup set, take the database offline and then reissue the RESTORE command.	|
|	3108	|	16	|	No	|	To restore the master database, the server must be running in single-user mode. For information on starting in single-user mode, see "How to: Start an Instance of SQL Server (sqlservr.exe)" in Books Online.	|
|	3109	|	16	|	No	|	Master can only be restored and fully recovered in a single step using a full database backup. Options such as NORECOVERY, STANDBY, and STOPAT are not supported.	|
|	3110	|	14	|	No	|	User does not have permission to RESTORE database '%.*ls'.	|
|	3111	|	16	|	No	|	Page %S_PGID is a control page which cannot be restored in isolation. To repair this page, the entire file must be restored.	|
|	3112	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot restore any database other than master when the server is in single user mode.	|
|	3113	|	16	|	No	|	Invalid data was detected.	|
|	3115	|	16	|	No	|	The database is using the simple recovery model. It is not possible to restore a subset of the read-write data.	|
|	3116	|	16	|	No	|	The supplied backup is not on the same recovery path as the database, and is ineligible for use for an online file restore.	|
|	3117	|	16	|	No	|	The log or differential backup cannot be restored because no files are ready to rollforward.	|
|	3118	|	16	|	No	|	The database "%ls" does not exist. RESTORE can only create a database when restoring either a full backup or a file backup of the primary file.	|
|	3119	|	16	|	No	|	Problems were identified while planning for the RESTORE statement. Previous messages provide details.	|
|	3120	|	16	|	No	|	This backup set will not be restored because all data has already been restored to a point beyond the time covered by this backup set.	|
|	3121	|	16	|	No	|	The file "%ls" is on a recovery path that is inconsistent with application of this backup set. RESTORE cannot continue.	|
|	3122	|	16	|	No	|	File initialization failed. RESTORE cannot continue.	|
|	3123	|	16	|	No	|	Invalid database name '%.*ls' specified for backup or restore operation.	|
|	3125	|	16	|	No	|	The database is using the simple recovery model. The data in the backup it is not consistent with the current state of the database. Restoring more data is required before recovery is possible. Either restore a full file backup taken since the data was marked read-only, or restore the most recent base backup for the target data followed by a differential file backup.	|
|	3127	|	16	|	Yes	|	The file '%.*ls' of restored database '%ls' is being left in the defunct state because the database is using the simple recovery model and the file is marked for read-write access. Therefore, only read-only files can be recovered by piecemeal restore.	|
|	3128	|	16	|	No	|	File '%ls' has an unsupported page size (%d).	|
|	3129	|	16	|	No	|	The contents of the file "%ls" are not consistent with a transition into the restore sequence. A restore from a backup set may be required.	|
|	3130	|	10	|	No	|	The filegroup "%ls" is selected. At the time of backup it was known by the name "%ls"'. RESTORE will continue operating upon the renamed filegroup.	|
|	3131	|	10	|	No	|	The file "%ls" is selected. At the time of backup it was known by the name "%ls". RESTORE will continue operating upon the renamed file.	|
|	3132	|	16	|	No	|	The media set has %d media families but only %d are provided. All members must be provided.	|
|	3133	|	16	|	No	|	The volume on device "%ls" is sequence number %d of media family %d, but sequence number %d of media family %d is expected. Check that the device specifications and loaded media are correct.	|
|	3134	|	10	|	Yes	|	The differential base attribute for file '%ls' of database '%ls' has been reset because the file has been restored from a backup taken on a conflicting recovery path. The restore was allowed because the file was read-only and was consistent with the current status of the database. Any future differential backup of this file will require a new differential base.	|
|	3135	|	16	|	No	|	The backup set in file '%ls' was created by %hs and cannot be used for this restore operation.	|
|	3136	|	16	|	No	|	This differential backup cannot be restored because the database has not been restored to the correct earlier state.	|
|	3137	|	16	|	No	|	Database cannot be reverted. Either the primary or the snapshot names are improperly specified, all other snapshots have not been dropped, or there are missing files.	|
|	3138	|	16	|	No	|	The database cannot be reverted because FILESTREAM BLOBs are present.	|
|	3139	|	16	|	No	|	Restore to snapshot is not allowed with the master database.	|
|	3140	|	16	|	No	|	Could not adjust the space allocation for file '%ls'.	|
|	3141	|	16	|	No	|	The database to be restored was named '%ls'. Reissue the statement using the WITH REPLACE option to overwrite the '%ls' database.	|
|	3142	|	16	|	No	|	File "%ls" cannot be restored over the existing "%ls". Reissue the RESTORE statement using WITH REPLACE to overwrite pre-existing files, or WITH MOVE to identify an alternate location.	|
|	3143	|	16	|	No	|	The data set on device '%ls' is not a SQL Server backup set.	|
|	3144	|	16	|	No	|	File '%.*ls' was not backed up in file %d on device '%ls'. The file cannot be restored from this backup set.	|
|	3145	|	16	|	No	|	The STOPAT option is not supported for databases that use the SIMPLE recovery model.	|
|	3147	|	16	|	No	|	Backup and restore operations are not allowed on database tempdb.	|
|	3148	|	16	|	No	|	This RESTORE statement is invalid in the current context. The 'Recover Data Only' option is only defined for secondary filegroups when the database is in an online state. When the database is in an offline state filegroups cannot be specified.	|
|	3149	|	16	|	No	|	The file or filegroup "%ls" is not in a valid state for the "Recover Data Only" option to be used. Only secondary files in the OFFLINE or RECOVERY_PENDING state can be processed.	|
|	3150	|	10	|	No	|	The master database has been successfully restored. Shutting down SQL Server.	|
|	[3151](mssqlserver-3151-database-engine-error.md)	|	21	|	Yes	|	Failed to restore master database. Shutting down SQL Server. Check the error logs, and rebuild the master database. For more information about how to rebuild the master database, see SQL Server Books Online.	|
|	3153	|	16	|	No	|	The database is already fully recovered.	|
|	3154	|	16	|	No	|	The backup set holds a backup of a database other than the existing '%ls' database.	|
|	3155	|	16	|	No	|	The RESTORE operation cannot proceed because one or more files have been added or dropped from the database since the backup set was created.	|
|	[3156](mssqlserver-3156-database-engine-error.md)	|	16	|	No	|	File '%ls' cannot be restored to '%ls'. Use WITH MOVE to identify a valid location for the file.	|
|	[3159](mssqlserver-3159-database-engine-error.md)	|	16	|	No	|	The tail of the log for the database "%ls" has not been backed up. Use BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY to backup the log if it contains work you do not want to lose. Use the WITH REPLACE or WITH STOPAT clause of the RESTORE statement to just overwrite the contents of the log.	|
|	3161	|	16	|	No	|	The primary file is unavailable. It must be restored or otherwise made available.	|
|	3163	|	16	|	No	|	The transaction log was damaged. All data files must be restored before RESTORE LOG can be attempted.	|
|	3165	|	16	|	No	|	Database '%ls' was restored, however an error was encountered while replication was being restored/removed. The database has been left offline. See the topic MSSQL_ENG003165 in SQL Server Books Online.	|
|	3166	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE DATABASE could not drop database '%ls'. Drop the database and then reissue the RESTORE DATABASE statement.	|
|	3167	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE could not start database '%ls'.	|
|	[3168](mssqlserver-3168-database-engine-error.md)	|	16	|	No	|	The backup of the system database on the device %ls cannot be restored because it was created by a different version of the server (%ls) than this server (%ls).	|
|	[3169](mssqlserver-3169-database-engine-error.md)	|	16	|	No	|	The database was backed up on a server running version %ls. That version is incompatible with this server, which is running version %ls. Either restore the database on a server that supports the backup, or use a backup that is compatible with this server.	|
|	3170	|	16	|	No	|	The STANDBY filename is invalid.	|
|	3171	|	16	|	No	|	File %ls is defunct and cannot be restored into the online database.	|
|	3172	|	16	|	No	|	Filegroup %ls is defunct and cannot be restored into the online database.	|
|	3173	|	16	|	No	|	The STOPAT clause provided with this RESTORE statement indicates that the tail of the log contains changes that must be backed up to reach the target point in time. The tail of the log for the database "%ls" has not been backed up. Use BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY to back up the log, or use the WITH REPLACE clause in your RESTORE statement to overwrite the tail of the log.	|
|	3174	|	16	|	No	|	The file '%ls' cannot be moved by this RESTORE operation.	|
|	3175	|	10	|	No	|	RESTORE FILEGROUP="%ls" was specified, but not all of its files are present in the backup set. File "%ls" is missing. RESTORE will continue, but if you want all files to be restored, you must restore other backup sets.	|
|	[3176](mssqlserver-3176-database-engine-error.md)	|	16	|	No	|	File '%ls' is claimed by '%ls'(%d) and '%ls'(%d). The WITH MOVE clause can be used to relocate one or more files.	|
|	3178	|	16	|	No	|	File %ls is not in the correct state to have this differential backup applied to it.	|
|	3179	|	16	|	No	|	The system database cannot be moved by RESTORE.	|
|	3180	|	16	|	No	|	This backup cannot be restored using WITH STANDBY because a database upgrade is needed. Reissue the RESTORE without WITH STANDBY.	|
|	[3181](mssqlserver-3181-database-engine-error.md)	|	10	|	No	|	Attempting to restore this backup may encounter storage space problems. Subsequent messages will provide details.	|
|	3182	|	16	|	No	|	The backup set cannot be restored because the database was damaged when the backup occurred. Salvage attempts may exploit WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR.	|
|	3183	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE detected an error on page (%d:%d) in database "%ls" as read from the backup set.	|
|	3184	|	10	|	No	|	RESTORE WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR was successful but some damage was encountered. Inconsistencies in the database are possible.	|
|	3185	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE cannot apply this backup set because the database is suspect. Restore a backup set that repairs the damage.	|
|	3186	|	16	|	No	|	The backup set has been damaged. RESTORE will not attempt to apply this backup set.	|
|	3187	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE WITH CHECKSUM cannot be specified because the backup set does not contain checksum information.	|
|	3188	|	10	|	No	|	The backup set was written with damaged data by a BACKUP WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR.	|
|	3189	|	16	|	No	|	Damage to the backup set was detected.	|
|	3190	|	16	|	No	|	Filegroup '%ls' cannot be restored because it does not exist in the backup set.	|
|	3191	|	16	|	No	|	Restore cannot continue because file '%ls' cannot be written. Ensure that all files in the database are writable.	|
|	3192	|	10	|	No	|	Restore was successful but deferred transactions remain. These transactions cannot be resolved because there are data that is unavailable. Either use RESTORE to make that data available or drop the filegroups if you never need this data again. Dropping the filegroup results in a defunct filegroup.	|
|	3194	|	16	|	No	|	Page %S_PGID is beyond the end of the file. Only pages that are in the current range of the file can be restored.	|
|	3195	|	16	|	No	|	Page %S_PGID cannot be restored from this backup set. RESTORE PAGE can only be used from full backup sets or from the first log or differential backup taken since the file was added to the database.	|
|	3196	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE master WITH SNAPSHOT is not supported. To restore master from a snapshot backup, stop the service and copy the data and log file.	|

This can be caused by contention with Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) transactions or other local marked transaction that have prepared, but not committed or aborted. Try the operation again and if the error persists, determine the source of the contention.	|
|	3929	|	16	|	No	|	No distributed or bound transaction is allowed in single user database.	|
|	3930	|	16	|	No	|	The current transaction cannot be committed and cannot support operations that write to the log file. Roll back the transaction.	|
|	3931	|	16	|	No	|	The current transaction cannot be committed and cannot be rolled back to a savepoint. Roll back the entire transaction.	|
|	3932	|	16	|	No	|	The save point name "%.*ls" that was provided is too long. The maximum allowed length is %d characters.	|
|	3933	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot promote the transaction to a distributed transaction because there is an active save point in this transaction.	|
|	3934	|	14	|	No	|	The current user cannot use this FILESTREAM transaction context. To obtain a valid FILESTREAM transaction context, use GET_FILESTREAM_TRANSACTION_CONTEXT.	|
|	3935	|	16	|	No	|	A FILESTREAM transaction context could not be initialized. This might be caused by a resource shortage. Retry the operation. Error code: 0x%x.	|
|	3936	|	16	|	No	|	The transaction could not be committed because an error occurred while tyring to flush FILESTREAM data to disk. A file may have been open at commit time or a disk I/O error may have occurred. '%.*ls' was one of the one or more files involved. ErorrCode: 0x%x	|
|	[3937](mssqlserver-3937-database-engine-error.md)	|	16	|	No	|	While rolling back a transaction, an error occurred while trying to deliver a rollback notification to the FILESTREAM filter driver. Error code: 0x%0x.	|
|	3938	|	18	|	No	|	The transaction has been stopped because it conflicted with the execution of a FILESTREAM close operation using the same transaction. The transaction will be rolled back.	|
|	3939	|	16	|	No	|	An uncommittable transaction was detected at the beginning of the batch. The transaction was rolled back. This was caused by an error that occurred during the processing of a FILESTREAM request in the context of this transaction.	|
|	3950	|	16	|	No	|	Version store scan timed out when attempting to read the next row. Please try the statement again later when the system is not as busy.	|
|	3951	|	16	|	No	|	Transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the statement was run under snapshot isolation but the transaction did not start in snapshot isolation. You cannot change the isolation level of the transaction to snapshot after the transaction has started unless the transaction was originally started under snapshot isolation level.	|
|	3952	|	16	|	No	|	Snapshot isolation transaction failed accessing database '%.*ls' because snapshot isolation is not allowed in this database. Use ALTER DATABASE to allow snapshot isolation.	|
|	3953	|	16	|	No	|	Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the database was not recovered when the current transaction was started. Retry the transaction after the database has recovered.	|
|	3954	|	16	|	No	|	Snapshot isolation transaction failed to start in database '%.*ls' because the ALTER DATABASE command that disallows snapshot isolation had started before this transaction began. The database is in transition to OFF state. You will either need to change the isolation level of the transaction or re-enable the snapshot isolation in the database.	|
|	3955	|	16	|	No	|	Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the recovery was skipped for this database. You must recover the database before you can run a transaction under snapshot isolation.	|
|	3956	|	16	|	No	|	Snapshot isolation transaction failed to start in database '%.*ls' because the ALTER DATABASE command which enables snapshot isolation for this database has not finished yet. The database is in transition to pending ON state. You must wait until the ALTER DATABASE Command completes successfully.	|
|	3957	|	16	|	No	|	Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the database did not allow snapshot isolation when the current transaction started. It may help to retry the transaction.	|
|	3958	|	16	|	No	|	Transaction aborted when accessing versioned row in table '%.*ls' in database '%.*ls'. Requested versioned row was not found. Your tempdb is probably out of space. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning.	|
|	3959	|	10	|	Yes	|	Version store is full. New version(s) could not be added. A transaction that needs to access the version store may be rolled back. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning.	|
|	3960	|	16	|	No	|	Snapshot isolation transaction aborted due to update conflict. You cannot use snapshot isolation to access table '%.*ls' directly or indirectly in database '%.*ls' to update, delete, or insert the row that has been modified or deleted by another transaction. Retry the transaction or change the isolation level for the update/delete statement.	|
|	[3961](mssqlserver-3961-database-engine-error.md)	|	16	|	No	|	Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the object accessed by the statement has been modified by a DDL statement in another concurrent transaction since the start of this transaction. It is disallowed because the metadata is not versioned. A concurrent update to metadata can lead to inconsistency if mixed with snapshot isolation.	|
|	3962	|	16	|	No	|	Bind to another transaction while executing SQL Server internal query is not supported. Check your logon trigger definition and remove any sp_bindsession usage if any. If this error is not happening during logon trigger execution, contact production support team.	|
|	3963	|	16	|	No	|	Transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because distributed transactions are not supported under snapshot isolation.	|
|	3964	|	16	|	No	|	Transaction failed because this DDL statement is not allowed inside a snapshot isolation transaction. Since metadata is not versioned, a metadata change can lead to inconsistency if mixed within snapshot isolation.	|
|	3965	|	16	|	No	|	The PROMOTE TRANSACTION request failed because there is no local transaction active.	|
|	3966	|	17	|	No	|	Transaction is rolled back when accessing version store. It was earlier marked as victim when the version store was shrunk due to insufficient space in tempdb. This transaction was marked as a victim earlier because it may need the row version(s) that have already been removed to make space in tempdb. Retry the transaction	|
|	3967	|	17	|	Yes	|	Insufficient space in tempdb to hold row versions. Need to shrink the version store to free up some space in tempdb. Transaction (id=%I64d xsn=%I64d spid=%d elapsed_time=%d) has been marked as victim and it will be rolled back if it accesses the version store. If the problem persists, the likely cause is improperly sized tempdb or long running transactions. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning.	|
|	3968	|	10	|	No	|	Snapshot isolation or read committed snapshot is not available in database '%.*ls' because SQL Server was started with one or more undocumented trace flags that prevent enabling database for versioning. Transaction started with snapshot isolation will fail and a query running under read committed snapshot will succeed but will resort back to lock based read committed.	|
|	3969	|	16	|	No	|	Distributed transaction is not supported while running SQL Server internal query. Check your logon trigger definition and remove any distributed transaction usage if any. If this error is not happening during logon trigger execution, contact production support team.	|
|	3970	|	16	|	No	|	This operation conflicts with another pending operation on this transaction. The operation failed.	|
|	3971	|	16	|	No	|	The server failed to resume the transaction. Desc:%I64x.	|
|	3972	|	20	|	Yes	|	Incoming Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol is incorrect. Transaction Manager event has wrong length. Event type: %d. Expected length: %d. Actual length: %d.	|
|	3973	|	16	|	No	|	The database is currently being used by another thread under the same workspace in exclusive mode. The operation failed.	|
|	3974	|	16	|	No	|	The number of databases in exclusive mode usage under a workspace is limited. Because the limit has been exceeded, the operation failed.	|
|	3975	|	16	|	No	|	The varchar(max) data type is not supported for sp_getbindtoken. The batch has been aborted.	|
|	3976	|	16	|	No	|	The transaction name has the odd length %d. The batch has been aborted.	|
|	3977	|	16	|	No	|	The savepoint name cannot be NULL. The batch has been aborted.	|
|	3978	|	16	|	No	|	Beginning a new transaction after rollback to save point is not allowed.	|
|	3979	|	16	|	No	|	The TM request is longer than expected. The request is not processed.	|
|	3980	|	16	|	No	|	The request failed to run because the batch is aborted, this can be caused by abort signal sent from client, or another request is running in the same session, which makes the session busy.	|
|	3981	|	16	|	No	|	The transaction operation cannot be performed because there are pending requests working on this transaction.	|
|	3982	|	16	|	No	|	New transaction is not allowed to be started while DTC or bound transaction is active.	|
|	3983	|	16	|	No	|	The operation failed because the session is not single threaded.	|
|	3984	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot acquire a database lock during a transaction change.	|
|	3985	|	16	|	No	|	An error occurred during the changing of transaction context. This is usually caused by low memory in the system. Try to free up more memory.	|
|	3986	|	19	|	No	|	The transaction timestamps ran out. Restart the server.	|
|	3987	|	10	|	No	|	SNAPSHOT ISOLATION is always enabled in this database.	|
|	3988	|	16	|	No	|	New transaction is not allowed because there are other threads running in the session.	|
|	3989	|	16	|	No	|	New request is not allowed to start because it should come with valid transaction descriptor.	|
|	3990	|	16	|	No	|	Transaction is not allowed to commit inside of a user defined routine, trigger or aggregate because the transaction is not started in that CLR level. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting.	|
|	3991	|	16	|	No	|	The context transaction which was active before entering user defined routine, trigger or aggregate "%.*ls" has been ended inside of it, which is not allowed. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting.	|
|	3992	|	16	|	No	|	Transaction count has been changed from %d to %d inside of user defined routine, trigger or aggregate "%.*ls". This is not allowed and user transaction will be rolled back. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting.	|
|	3993	|	16	|	No	|	The user transaction that has been started in user defined routine, trigger or aggregate "%.*ls" is not ended upon exiting from it. This is not allowed and the transaction will be rolled back. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting.	|
|	3994	|	16	|	No	|	User defined routine, trigger or aggregate tried to rollback a transaction that is not started in that CLR level. An exception will be thrown to prevent execution of rest of the user defined routine, trigger or aggregate.	|
|	3995	|	16	|	No	|	Unknown transaction isolation level %d, valid value range is 0 to 5.	|
|	3996	|	16	|	No	|	Snapshot isolation level is not supported for distributed transaction. Use another isolation level or do not use distributed transaction.	|
|	3997	|	16	|	No	|	A transaction that was started in a MARS batch is still active at the end of the batch. The transaction is rolled back.	|
|	3998	|	16	|	No	|	Uncommittable transaction is detected at the end of the batch. The transaction is rolled back.	|

|	4184	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot retrieve table data for the query operation because the table "%.*ls" schema is being altered too frequently. Because the table "%.*ls" contains a filtered index or filtered statistics, changes to the table schema require a refresh of all table data. Retry the query operation, and if the problem persists, use SQL Server Profiler to identify what schema-altering operations are occurring.	|
|	4185	|	16	|	No	|	This action cannot be performed on a system type.	|
|	[4186](mssqlserver-4186-database-engine-error.md)	|	16	|	No	|	Column '%ls.%.*ls' cannot be referenced in the OUTPUT clause because the column definition contains a subquery or references a function that performs user or system data access. A function is assumed by default to perform data access if it is not schemabound. Consider removing the subquery or function from the column definition or removing the column from the OUTPUT clause.	|
|	4202	|	16	|	No	|	BACKUP LOG is not possible because bulk logged changes exist in the database and one or more filegroups are unavailable.	|
|	4208	|	16	|	No	|	The statement %hs is not allowed while the recovery model is SIMPLE. Use BACKUP DATABASE or change the recovery model using ALTER DATABASE.	|
|	4212	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot back up the log of the master database. Use BACKUP DATABASE instead.	|
|	4214	|	16	|	No	|	BACKUP LOG cannot be performed because there is no current database backup.	|
|	4215	|	10	|	No	|	The log was not truncated because records at the beginning of the log are pending replication or Change Data Capture. Ensure the Log Reader Agent or capture job is running or use sp_repldone to mark transactions as distributed or captured.	|
|	4217	|	10	|	No	|	BACKUP LOG cannot modify the database because the database is read-only. The backup will continue, although subsequent backups will duplicate the work of this backup.	|
|	4218	|	16	|	No	|	Bulk-logged operations exist in the database. Perform a BACKUP LOG.	|
|	4302	|	16	|	No	|	The option "%ls" conflicts with online restore. Remove the conflicting option and reissue the command.	|
|	4303	|	16	|	No	|	The roll forward start point is now at log sequence number (LSN) %.*s. Additional roll forward past LSN %.*s is required to complete the restore sequence.	|
|	4305	|	16	|	No	|	The log in this backup set begins at LSN %.*ls, which is too recent to apply to the database. An earlier log backup that includes LSN %.*ls can be restored.	|
|	4307	|	16	|	No	|	The online restore to database '%ls' failed. It may be appropriate to perform an offline restore instead. To force an offline restore, first take the database offline using the ALTER DATABASE statement.	|
|	4308	|	10	|	No	|	The online restore is complete, but WITH NORECOVERY was specified. Use RESTORE WITH RECOVERY to bring affected data online.	|
|	4309	|	16	|	No	|	The state of file "%ls" prevents restoring individual pages. Only a file restore is currently possible.	|
|	4310	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE PAGE is not allowed on file "%ls" because the file is not online.	|
|	4311	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE PAGE is not allowed from backups taken with earlier versions of SQL Server.	|
|	4312	|	16	|	No	|	This log cannot be restored because a gap in the log chain was created. Use more recent data backups to bridge the gap.	|
|	4315	|	10	|	No	|	Some files still require more restore steps before the online restore sequence can be completed.	|
|	4318	|	16	|	No	|	File '%ls' has been rolled forward to LSN %.*ls. This log terminates at LSN %.*ls, which is too early to apply the WITH RECOVERY option. Reissue the RESTORE LOG statement WITH NORECOVERY.	|
|	4319	|	16	|	No	|	A previous restore operation was interrupted and did not complete processing on file '%ls'. Either restore the backup set that was interrupted or restart the restore sequence.	|
|	4320	|	16	|	No	|	The file "%ls" was not fully restored by a database or file restore. The entire file must be successfully restored before applying this backup set.	|
|	4322	|	10	|	No	|	This backup set contains records that were logged before the designated point in time. The database is being left in the restoring state so that more roll forward can be performed.	|
|	4323	|	16	|	No	|	A previous RESTORE WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR operation left the database in a potentially damaged state. To continue this RESTORE sequence, all further steps must include the CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR option.	|
|	4326	|	16	|	No	|	The log in this backup set terminates at LSN %.*ls, which is too early to apply to the database. A more recent log backup that includes LSN %.*ls can be restored.	|
|	4327	|	16	|	No	|	The log in this backup set contains bulk-logged changes. Point-in-time recovery was inhibited. The database has been rolled forward to the end of the log.	|
|	4328	|	16	|	No	|	The file "%ls" is missing. Roll forward stops at log sequence number %.*ls. The file is created at log sequence number (LSN) %.*ls, dropped at LSN %.*ls. Restore the transaction log beyond the point in time when the file was dropped, or restore data to be consistent with rest of the database.	|
|	4329	|	10	|	No	|	This log file contains records logged before the designated mark. The database is being left in the Restoring state so you can apply another log file.	|
|	4330	|	16	|	No	|	This backup set cannot be applied because it is on a recovery path that is inconsistent with the database. The recovery path is the sequence of data and log backups that have brought the database to a particular recovery point. Find a compatible backup to restore, or restore the rest of the database to match a recovery point within this backup set, which will restore the database to a different point in time. For more information about recovery paths, see SQL Server Books Online.	|
|	4331	|	16	|	No	|	The database cannot be recovered because the files have been restored to inconsistent points in time.	|
|	4332	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE LOG has been halted. To use the database in its current state, run RESTORE DATABASE %ls WITH RECOVERY.	|
|	4333	|	16	|	No	|	The database cannot be recovered because the log was not restored.	|
|	4334	|	16	|	No	|	The named mark does not identify a valid LSN.	|
|	4335	|	16	|	No	|	The specified STOPAT time is too early. All or part of the database is already rolled forward beyond that point.	|
|	4336	|	16	|	No	|	The filegroup "%ls" has been dropped and cannot be restored into the online database.	|
|	4337	|	16	|	No	|	The file "%ls" has been dropped and cannot be restored into the online database.	|
|	4338	|	16	|	No	|	The STOPAT clause specifies a point too early to allow this backup set to be restored. Choose a different stop point or use RESTORE DATABASE WITH RECOVERY to recover at the current point.	|
|	4339	|	10	|	No	|	This RESTORE statement successfully performed some actions, but the database could not be brought online because one or more RESTORE steps are needed. Previous messages indicate reasons why recovery cannot occur at this point.	|
|	4340	|	16	|	No	|	The point-in-time clause of this RESTORE statement is restricted for use by RESTORE LOG statements only. Omit the clause or use a clause that includes a timestamp.	|
|	4341	|	16	|	No	|	This log backup contains bulk-logged changes. It cannot be used to stop at an arbitrary point in time.	|
|	4342	|	16	|	No	|	Point-in-time recovery is not possible unless the primary filegroup is part of the restore sequence. Omit the point-in-time clause or restore the primary filegroup.	|
|	4343	|	16	|	No	|	The database has been rolled forward to the end of this backup set and beyond the specified point in time. RESTORE WITH RECOVERY can be used to accept the current recovery point.	|
|	4344	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE PAGE is not allowed on read-only databases or filegroups.	|
|	4345	|	10	|	No	|	Problems recording information in the msdb..suspect_pages table were encountered. This error does not interfere with any activity except maintenance of the suspect_pages table. Check the error log for more information.	|
|	4346	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE PAGE is not allowed with databases that use the simple recovery model.	|
|	4347	|	16	|	No	|	The current restore sequence was previously interrupted during the transition to the online state. RESTORE DATABASE WITH RECOVERY can be used to complete the transition to online.	|
|	4348	|	16	|	No	|	The online restore to database '%ls' failed. It may be appropriate to perform an offline restore instead. An offline restore is initiated by using BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY.	|
|	4349	|	16	|	No	|	The log in this backup set begins at LSN %.*ls, which is too recent to apply to the database. This restore sequence needs to initialize the log to start at LSN %.*ls. Reissue the RESTORE LOG statement using an earlier log backup.	|
|	4350	|	16	|	No	|	The list of pages provided with the RESTORE PAGE statement is incorrectly formatted. Prior to the problem %d pages were correctly identified. The problem was hit at character offset %d. Check that all pages are identified by numeric <file>:<page> pairs with commas separating each pair. For example: PAGE='1:57,2:31'.	|
|	4351	|	16	|	No	|	Backups taken on earlier versions of SQL Server are not supported by fn_dump_dblog.	|
|	4352	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE LOG is not supported from this data backup because file '%ls' is too old. Use a regular log backup to continue the restore sequence.	|
|	4353	|	16	|	No	|	Conflicting file relocations have been specified for file '%.*ls'. Only a single WITH MOVE clause should be specified for any logical file name.	|
|	4354	|	10	|	Yes	|	The file '%.*ls' of restored database '%ls' is being left in the defunct state because the database is being upgraded from a prior version. Piecemeal restore is not supported when an upgrade is involved.	|
|	4355	|	16	|	No	|	The revert command is incorrectly specified. The RESTORE statement must be of the form: RESTORE DATABASE <x> FROM DATABASE_SNAPSHOT = <y>.	|
|	4356	|	10	|	No	|	Restore is complete on database '%ls'. The database is now available.	|
|	4357	|	16	|	No	|	Restore cannot take '%ls' offline because changes exist that require a log backup. Take a log backup and then retry the RESTORE.	|
|	4358	|	16	|	No	|	The database can not be brought online because file '%ls' is currently restored to LSN %.*ls but must be restored to LSN %.*ls.	|
|	4359	|	16	|	No	|	The STOPAT option cannot be used with this partial restore sequence because one or more FILESTREAM filegroups are not included. The CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR option can be used to force the recovery, but this should only be used if you do not intend to subsequently restore the FILESTREAM filegroups.	|
|	4360	|	16	|	No	|	RESTORE LOG WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR was unsuccessful. Execution of the RESTORE command was aborted.	|
|	4403	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot update the view or function '%.*ls' because it contains aggregates, or a DISTINCT or GROUP BY clause, or PIVOT or UNPIVOT operator.	|

|	5124	|	16	|	Yes	|	The file header in '%ls' does not match the expected contents for file '%ls' of database '%ls'. The mismatch is possibly between the full-text catalog files and the related database. Perform a restore if necessary.	|
|	5125	|	24	|	No	|	File '%ls' appears to have been truncated by the operating system. Expected size is %I64d KB but actual size is %I64d KB.	|
|	5127	|	16	|	No	|	All files must be specified for database snapshot creation. Missing the file "%ls".	|
|	5128	|	17	|	No	|	Write to sparse file '%ls' failed due to lack of disk space.	|
|	5129	|	10	|	No	|	The log cannot be rebuilt when the primary file is read-only.	|
|	5130	|	10	|	No	|	The log cannot be rebuilt when database mirroring is enabled.	|
|	5131	|	10	|	No	|	The log was not rebuilt because there is more than one log file.	|
|	5132	|	16	|	No	|	The path specified by '%.*ls' cannot be used for FILESTREAM files because it is a raw device.	|
|	5133	|	16	|	No	|	Directory lookup for the file "%ls" failed with the operating system error %ls.	|
|	5134	|	16	|	No	|	The path that is specified by '%.*ls' cannot be used for FILESTREAM files because it is not on a supported file system.	|
|	5135	|	16	|	No	|	The path '%.*ls' cannot be used for FILESTREAM files. For information about supported paths, see SQL Server Books Online.	|
|	5136	|	16	|	No	|	The path specified by '%.*ls' cannot be used for a FILESTREAM container since it is contained in another FILESTREAM container.	|
|	5144	|	10	|	Yes	|	Autogrow of file '%.*ls' in database '%.*ls' was cancelled by user or timed out after %d milliseconds. Use ALTER DATABASE to set a smaller FILEGROWTH value for this file or to explicitly set a new file size.	|
|	5145	|	10	|	Yes	|	Autogrow of file '%.*ls' in database '%.*ls' took %d milliseconds. Consider using ALTER DATABASE to set a smaller FILEGROWTH for this file.	|
|	5149	|	16	|	No	|	MODIFY FILE encountered operating system error %ls while attempting to expand the physical file '%ls'.	|
|	5150	|	16	|	No	|	The size of a single log file must not be greater than 2 TB.	|
|	5159	|	24	|	No	|	Operating system error %.*ls on file "%.*ls" during %ls.	|
|	5161	|	16	|	Yes	|	An unexpected file id was encountered. File id %d was expected but %d was read from "%.*ls". Verify that files are mapped correctly in sys.master_files. ALTER DATABASE can be used to correct the mappings.	|
|	5169	|	16	|	No	|	FILEGROWTH cannot be greater than MAXSIZE for file '%.*ls'.	|
|	5170	|	16	|	Yes	|	Cannot create file '%ls' because it already exists. Change the file path or the file name, and retry the operation.	|
|	5171	|	16	|	No	|	%.*ls is not a primary database file.	|
|	5172	|	16	|	No	|	The header for file '%ls' is not a valid database file header. The %ls property is incorrect.	|
|	5173	|	16	|	Yes	|	One or more files do not match the primary file of the database. If you are attempting to attach a database, retry the operation with the correct files. If this is an existing database, the file may be corrupted and should be restored from a backup.	|
|	5174	|	16	|	No	|	Each file size must be greater than or equal to 512 KB.	|
|	5175	|	10	|	Yes	|	The file %.*ls has been expanded to allow recovery to succeed. After recovery completes, you can increase the size of the files in the database. Contact the system administrator for assistance.	|
|	5176	|	10	|	Yes	|	To allow recovery to succeed, the log file '%.*ls' has been expanded beyond its maximum size. After recovery completes, you should either increase the size of the log file in the database or schedule more frequent backups of the log (under the full or bulk-logged recovery model).	|
|	5177	|	16	|	Yes	|	An unexpected error occurred while checking the sector size for file '%.*ls'. Move the file to a local NTFS volume, where the sector size can be retrieved. Check the SQL Server error log for more information.	|
|	5178	|	16	|	Yes	|	Cannot use file '%.*ls' because it was originally formatted with sector size %d and is now on a volume with sector size %d. Move the file to a volume with a sector size that is the same as or smaller than the original sector size.	|
|	5179	|	16	|	Yes	|	Cannot use file '%.*ls', because it is on a volume with sector size %d. SQL Server supports a maximum sector size of 4096 bytes. Move the file to a volume with a compatible sector size.	|
|	5180	|	22	|	Yes	|	Could not open File Control Bank (FCB) for invalid file ID %d in database '%.*ls'. Verify the file location. Execute DBCC CHECKDB.	|

|	10526	|	16	|	No	|	Plan guide '%.*ls' matched statement after it was parameterized automatically by FORCED or SIMPLE parameterization, but the RECOMPILE hint it contains was ignored. RECOMPILE is not supported on automatically parameterized statements. Consider dropping this plan guide or removing RECOMPILE from it.	|
|	10527	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot drop %S_MSG '%.*ls' because its trigger '%.*ls' is referenced by plan guide '%.*ls'. Use sp_control_plan_guide to drop the plan guide first. Record the plan guide definition for future use if needed.	|
|	10528	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot create plan guide '%.*ls' because the object '%.*ls' is a temporary object.	|
|	10529	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot create plan guide '%.*ls' because its name is invalid. Plan guide name cannot begin with a '#' character.	|
|	10530	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot create plan guide '%.*ls' because there is already a planguide '%.*ls' of @type 'template' on @stmt.	|
|	[10531](mssqlserver-10531-database-engine-error.md)	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot create plan guide '%.*ls' because the statement specified by @statement_start_offset does not match any statement in specified module or batch.

|	10606	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot disable primary key index "%.*ls" on table "%.*ls" because the table is published for replication.	|
|	10607	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot disable the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because the indexed view is published for replication.	|
|	10608	|	16	|	No	|	The clustered index '%.*ls' on table '%.*ls' cannot be disabled because the table has change tracking enabled. Disable change tracking on the table before disabling the clustered index.	|
|	10609	|	16	|	No	|	The index '%.*ls' on table '%.*ls' cannot be disabled because the table has change tracking enabled. Change tracking requires a primary key constraint on the table, and disabling the index will drop the constraint. Disable change tracking on the table before disabling the index.	|
|	10610	|	16	|	No	|	Filtered %S_MSG '%.*ls' cannot be created on table '%.*ls' because the column '%.*ls' in the filter expression is a computed column. Rewrite the filter expression so that it does not include this column.	|
|	10611	|	16	|	No	|	Filtered index '%.*ls' cannot be created on object '%.*ls' because it is not a user table. Filtered indexes are only supported on tables. If you are trying to create a filtered index on a view, consider creating an indexed view with the filter expression incorporated in the view definition.	|
|	10612	|	16	|	No	|	Filtered %S_MSG '%.*ls' cannot be created on table '%.*ls' because the column '%.*ls' in the filter expression is compared with a constant of higher data type precedence or of a different collation. Converting a column to the data type of a constant is not supported for filtered %S_MSG. To resolve this error, explicitly convert the constant to the same data type and collation as the column '%.*ls'.	|
|	10617	|	16	|	No	|	Filtered %S_MSG '%.*ls' cannot be created on table '%.*ls' because the column '%.*ls' in the filter expression is compared with a constant that cannot be converted to the data type of the column. Rewrite the filter expression so that it does not include this comparison.	|
|	10618	|	16	|	No	|	Index '%.*ls' could not be created or rebuilt. The key length for this index (%d bytes) exceeds the maximum allowed length of '%d' bytes when using the vardecimal storage format.	|
|	10619	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot %S_MSG filtered index '%.*ls' on table '%.*ls' because the statement sets the IGNORE_DUP_KEY option to ON. Rewrite the statement so that it does not use the IGNORE_DUP_KEY option.	|
|	10620	|	16	|	No	|	Filtered %S_MSG '%.*ls' cannot be created on table '%.*ls' because the column '%.*ls' in the filter expression is of a CLR data type. Rewrite the filter expression so that it does not include this column.	|
|	10621	|	16	|	No	|	Filtered %S_MSG '%.*ls' cannot be created on table '%.*ls' because the filter expression contains a comparison with a literal NULL value. Rewrite the comparison to use the IS [NOT] NULL comparison operator to test for NULL values.	|
|	10622	|	16	|	No	|	The index '%.*ls' on table '%.*ls' could not be created because the column '%.*ls' in the filter expression of the index is a column set.	|

|	21537	|	16	|	No	|	The column '%s' in table '%s' is involved in a foreign key relationship with a column in table '%s', but this column was not found in the specified join clause. A logical record relationship between these tables should include this column.	|
|	21538	|	16	|	No	|	Table '%s' cannot have table '%s' as a parent in a logical record relationship because it already has a different parent table. A logical record relationship allows only one parent table for a given child table.	|
|	21539	|	16	|	No	|	A logical record relationship, specified by the @filter_type parameter, requires a one-to-one or a one-to-many join from the parent table to the child table. Either change the value of the @filter_type parameter, or set the @join_unique_key parameter to 1.	|
|	21540	|	16	|	No	|	You cannot drop a column defined as data type uniqueidentifier with the rowguidcol property because merge replication uses this column for tracking. To drop the column, you must first drop the table from all publications and subscriptions.	|
|	21541	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot complete ALTER TABLE command. Do not execute the command 'ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE TRIGGER ALL' on a published table. Reissue multiple 'ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_name' statements to disable each trigger individually on the given table.	|

|	21552	|	16	|	No	|	Merge data definition language (DDL) error: Dropping a column used in a row filter or a join filter is not allowed. To drop a column used in a row filter, first change the row filter using sp_changemergearticle. To drop a column used in a join filter, first drop the join filter using sp_dropmergefilter.	|
|	21561	|	16	|	No	|	The value specified for parameter %s = %d is not valid.	|
|	21564	|	16	|	No	|	The table %s contains the column msrepl_tran_version, which is used by replication. The column is set to NULL, but it must be set to NOT NULL. Replication failed to alter this column, so you must drop the column and then add the table as an article again using sp_addarticle. Replication will then add the column to the table.	|
|	21567	|	16	|	No	|	The call format VCALL cannot be used for the specified article. VCALL format can be used only for articles in publications that allow updating subscriptions. If you do not require updating subscriptions, specify a different call format. If you do require updating subscriptions, you must drop the publication and re-create it to specify that updating subscriptions are allowed.	|
|	21569	|	16	|	No	|	The article %s in the publication %s does not have a valid conflict table entry in the system table sysarticleupdates. This entry is required for publications that allow queued updating subscriptions. Check for errors in the last run of the Snapshot Agent.	|
|	21570	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot create the logical record relationship. Table '%s' does not have a foreign key referencing table '%s'. A logical record relationship requires a foreign key relationship between the parent and child tables.	|
|	21571	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot create the logical record relationship in publication '%s'. The use_partition_groups option for the publication must be set to "true" in order to use logical records. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the option to "true".	|
|	21572	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot add a logical record relationship because the foreign key constraint '%s' on table '%s' is disabled. To create the logical record relationship, first enable the foreign key constraint.	|
|	21573	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot add a logical record relationship because the foreign key constraint '%s' on table '%s' is defined with the NOT FOR REPLICATION option. To add the logical record relationship, first drop the foreign key constraint, and then re-create it without the NOT FOR REPLICATION option.	|
|	21574	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot add a logical record relationship because the article '%s' is published in publication '%s', which has a compatibility level lower than 90RTM. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM.	|
|	21575	|	16	|	No	|	The value specified for the property filter_type is not valid. Valid values are 1 (join filter only), 2 (logical record relation only), and 3 (join filter and logical record relation).	|
|	21576	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot add a logical record relationship between tables '%s' and '%s' because the foreign key column '%s' in table '%s' allows NULL values. Alter the column to disallow NULL values.	|
|	21578	|	16	|	No	|	In order to use partition_options of 2 (non overlapping partitions with multiple subscriptions per partition) or 3 (non overlapping partitions one subscription per partition) the publication '%s' must be enabled to use partition groups functionality. Use sp_changemergepublication to set 'use_partition_groups' to 'true'.	|
|	21579	|	16	|	No	|	Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article is involved in multiple join filters. Either select a value of 0 or 1 for the @partition_options parameter, or drop all but one of the join filters by using sp_dropmergefilter.	|
|	21580	|	16	|	No	|	Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article is involved in both a row filter and a join filter. Either select a value of 0 or 1 for the @partition_options parameter; drop the join filter by using sp_dropmergefilter; or change the row filter by using sp_changemergepublication.	|
|	21581	|	16	|	No	|	Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article has a join filter with a join_unique_key value of 0. Either select a value of 0 or 1 for the @partition_options parameter, or use sp_changemergefilter to specify a value of 1 for join_unique_key.	|
|	21582	|	16	|	No	|	Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article has a direct or indirect join filter relationship with parent article "%s". The parent article does not use the same value for partition_options. Use sp_changemergepublication to change the value for one of the articles.	|
|	21583	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot update the column in article '%s'. The article has a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the partition_options property, and the column is involved in a row filter and/or a join filter. In this situation, the column cannot be updated at a Subscriber or republisher; it must be updated at the top-level Publisher.	|
|	21584	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot insert the row for article '%s'. The row does not belong to the Subscriber's partition, and the article has a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the partition_options property. Nonoverlapping partitions do not allow out-of-partition inserts.	|
|	21585	|	16	|	No	|	Cannot specify custom article ordering in publication '%s' because the publication has a compatibility level lower than 90RTM. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM.	|
|	21597	|	16	|	No	|	The article includes only the rowguidcol column. You must publish at least one other column.	|
|	21598	|	16	|	No	|	Modifying DDL triggers created by replication is disallowed since these are required to track DDL changes.	|
|	21599	|	16	|	No	|	The parameters @article and @join_articlename cannot have the same value. Specify different articles for the two parameters; self-joins are not permitted.	|

|	22582	|	16	|	No	|	Article '%s' cannot be added or modified in publication '%s'. The replication of FILESTREAM columns is not supported for publications that have a 'publication_compatibility_level' of less than "90RTM" (SQL Server 2005). Specify a 'publication_compatibility_level' greater than or equal to "90RTM" by using sp_addmergepublication or sp_changemergepublication, or partition the article vertically so that the FILESTREAM column is not replicated.	|
|	22583	|	16	|	No	|	Article '%s' cannot be added or modified in publication '%s'. The replication of FILESTREAM columns is not supported for articles that have a 'schema_option' set to 0x20000000. This converts large object data types to data types that are supported on earlier versions of Microsoft SQL Server. Remove this 'schema_option' setting by using sp_addmergepublication or sp_changemergepublication, or partition the article vertically so that the FILESTREAM column is not replicated.	|
|	22584	|	10	|	No	|	Warning: Values of some of the flags specified in the 'schema_option' property are not compatible with the publication's compatibility level. The modified schema_option value of '%s' will be used instead.	|
|	22585	|	10	|	No	|	The schema option to script out the FILESTREAM attribute on varbinary(max) columns has been enabled for article '%s'. Enabling this option after the article is created can cause replication to fail when the data in a FILESTREAM column exceeds 2GB and there is a conflict during replication. If you want FILESTREAM data to be replicated, drop and re-create the article, and specify the appropriate schema option when you re-create the article.	|
|	22586	|	16	|	No	|	Column '%s' cannot be added or modified in article '%s' of publication '%s'. The DDL operatoin on hierarchyid and FILESTREAM columns is not supported for publications that have a 'sync_mode' of 1 (character mode) or with a lower than 90RTM backward compatibility level.	|

|	30076	|	10	|	No	|	Full-text crawl forward progress information for database ID: %d, table ID: %d, catalog ID: %d has been reset due to the modification of the clustered index. Crawl will re-start from the beginning when it is unpaused.	|
|	30077	|	16	|	No	|	The full-text query did not use the value specified for the OPTIMIZE FOR query hint. Only single terms are allowed as values for full-text queries that contain an OPTIMIZE FOR query hint. Modify the OPTIMIZE FOR query hint value to be a single, non-empty term.	|
|	30078	|	10	|	No	|	The fulltext query did not use the value specified for the OPTIMIZE FOR hint because the query contained more than one type of full-text logical operator.	|
|	30079	|	10	|	No	|	The full text query ignored UNKNOWN in the OPTIMIZE FOR hint.	|
|	30080	|	16	|	No	|	The full-text population on table '%ls' cannot be started because the full-text catalog is importing data from existing catalogs. After the import operation finishes, rerun the command.	|

This can occur if an incorrectly configured or malfunctioning linguistic component, such as a wordbreaker, stemmer or filter has caused an irrecoverable error during full-text indexing or query processing. The process will be restarted automatically.	|
|	30090	|	10	|	No	|	A new instance of the full-text filter daemon host process has been successfully started.	|
|	30091	|	10	|	No	|	A request to start a full-text index population on table or indexed view '%.*ls' is ignored because a population is currently paused. Either resume or stop the paused population. To resume it, use the following Transact-SQL statement: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON %.*ls RESUME POPULATION. To stop it, use the following statement: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON %.*ls STOP POPULATION.	|
|	30092	|	16	|	No	|	Full-text stoplist ID '%d' does not exist.	|
|	30093	|	17	|	No	|	The SQL Server word-breaking client failed to initialize. This might be because a filter daemon host process is not in a valid state. This can prevent SQL Server from initializing critical system objects. Full-text queries will fail until this issue is resolved. Try stopping SQL Server and any filter daemon host processes and then restarting the instance of SQL Server.	|
|	30094	|	17	|	No	|	The full-text indexing pipeline could not be initialized. This might be because the resources on the system are too low to allocate memory or create tasks. Try restarting the instance of SQL Server.	|
|	30095	|	10	|	No	|	The version of the language components used by full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%ls' is different from the version of the language components included this version of SQL Server. The full-text catalog will still be imported as part of database upgrade. To avoid any possible inconsistencies of query results, consider rebuilding the full-text catalog.	|
|	30096	|	10	|	No	|	A full-text retry pass of %ls population started for table or indexed view '%ls'. Table or indexed view ID is '%d'. Database ID is '%d'.	|
|	30097	|	10	|	No	|	The fulltext catalog upgrade failed because of an inconsistency in metadata between sys.master_files and sys.fulltext_catalogs for the catalog ID %d in database ID %d. Try to reattach this database. If this fails, then the catalog will need to be dropped or recreated before attach.	|
|	30098	|	10	|	No	|	An internal query to load data for a crawl on database '%.*ls' and table '%.*ls' failed with error code %d. Check the sql error code for more information about the condition causing this failure. The crawl needs to be restarted after this condition is removed.	|
