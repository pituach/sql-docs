|Message Text|The Merge Agent failed after detecting that retention-based metadata cleanup has deleted metadata at the Publisher for changes not yet sent to the Subscriber. You must reinitialize the subscription (without upload).|  
  
## Explanation

> [!CAUTION]  
>  Error -2147199402 may also be caused by other problems with the metadata, such as configuring the publication for aggressive cleanup or subscriber syncing outside of the retention period.

> [!NOTE]
