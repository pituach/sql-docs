# Configure PolyBase to access external data in MongoDB

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

The article explains how to use PolyBase on a SQL Server instance to query external data in MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't installed PolyBase, see [PolyBase installation](polybase-installation.md).

## Configure an External Table

To query the data from an MongoDB data source, you must create external tables to reference the external data. This section provides sample code to create these external tables.

These objects will create in this section:

- CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL (Transact-SQL)
- CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE (Transact-SQL)
- CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE (Transact-SQL)
- CREATE STATISTICS (Transact-SQL)

1. Create a master key on the database, if one does not already exist. This is required to encrypt the credential secret.

     ```sql
      CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'password';  
     ```
    ## Arguments
    PASSWORD ='password'

    Is the password that is used to encrypt the master key in the database. password must meet the Windows password policy requirements of the computer that is hosting the instance of SQL Server.

1.   Create a database scoped credential for accessing the MongoDB source.

     ```sql
     /*  specify credentials to external data source
     *  IDENTITY: user name for external source.  
     *  SECRET: password for external source.
     */
     CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL credential_name 
     WITH IDENTITY = 'username', Secret = 'password';
     ```

1.  Create an external data source with [CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-data-source-transact-sql.md).

     ```sql
     /*  LOCATION: Location string should be of format '<type>://<server>[:<port>]'.
    *  PUSHDOWN: specify whether computation should be pushed down to the source. ON by default.
    *CONNECTION_OPTIONS: Specify driver location
    *  CREDENTIAL: the database scoped credential, created above.
    */  
    CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE external_data_source_name
    WITH (
    LOCATION = mongodb://<server>[:<port>],
    -- PUSHDOWN = ON | OFF,
      CREDENTIAL = credential_name
    );
     ```

1.  Create external tables that represent data stored in external MongoDB system [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-table-transact-sql.md).

     ```sql
     /*  LOCATION: MongoDB table/view in '<database_name>.<schema_name>.<object_name>' format
     *  DATA_SOURCE: the external data source, created above.
     */
     CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE customers(
     [O_ORDERKEY] DECIMAL(38) NOT NULL,
     [O_CUSTKEY] DECIMAL(38) NOT NULL,
     [O_ORDERSTATUS] CHAR COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN NOT NULL,
     [O_TOTALPRICE] DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
     [O_ORDERDATE] DATETIME2(0) NOT NULL,
     [O_COMMENT] VARCHAR(79) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN NOT NULL
     )
     WITH (
     LOCATION='customer',
     DATA_SOURCE= external_data_source_name
     );
     ```

1. **Optional:** Create statistics on an external table.

    We recommend creating statistics on external table columns, especially the ones used for joins, filters and aggregates, for optimal query performance.

     ```sql
      CREATE STATISTICS statistics_name ON customer (C_CUSTKEY) WITH FULLSCAN; 
     ```


## Flattening
 flattening  is enabled for nested and repeated data from MongoDB document collections. User is required to enable `create an external table` and explicitly specify a relational schema over MongoDB document collections that may have nested and/or repeated data. We will enable auto-schema detection over mongo document collections in future milestones.
JSON nested/repeated data types will be flattened as follows

* Object: unordered key/value collection enclosed in curly braces (nested)

   - We will create a table column for each object key

     * Column Name: objectname_keyname

* Array: ordered values, separated by commas, enclosed in square brackets (repeated)

   - We will add a new table row for each array item

   - We will create a column per array to store the array item index

     * Column Name: arrayname_index

     * Data Type: bigint

There are several potential issues with this technique, two of them being:

* an empty repeated field will effectively mask the data contained in the flat fields of the same record

* the presence of multiple repeated fields can result in an explosion of the number of produced rows

As an example, we evaluate the MongoDB sample dataset restaurant collection stored in non-relational JSON format. Each restaurant has a nested address field and an array of grades it was assigned on different days. The figure below illustrates a typical restaurant with nested address and nested-repeated grades.

![MongoDB flattening](../../relational-databases/polybase/media/mongo-flattening.png "MongoDB restaurant flattening")

Object address will be flattened as below:

* Nested field restaurant.address.building becomes restaurant.address_building
* Nested field restaurant.address.coord becomes restaurant.address_coord
* Nested field restaurant.address.street becomes restaurant.address_street
* Nested field restaurant.address.zipcode becomes restaurant.address_zipcode

Array grades will be flattened as below:
| grades_date | grades_grade  | games_score | 
| ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
|1393804800000 |A |2|
|1378857600000|A |6|
|135898560000 |A |10|
|1322006400000|A |9|
|1299715200000 |B |14|

## Cosmos DB Connection

Using the Cosmos DB mongo api and the Mongo DB PolyBase connector you can create an external table of a **Cosmos DB instance**. This accomplished by following the same steps listed above. Make sure the Database scoped credential, Sever address, port, and location string reflect that of the Cosmos DB server.
