# Rename a Database

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This topic describes how to rename a user-defined database in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. The name of the database can include any characters that follow the rules for identifiers.

- To rename a database, using:

     [Transact-SQL](#rename-a-database-using-transact-sql)

> [!NOTE]
> To rename a database in Azure SQL Data Warehouse or Parallel Data Warehouse, use the [RENAME (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/rename-transact-sql.md) statement.
  
## Before You Begin
  
### Limitations and Restrictions  
  
- System databases cannot be renamed.
- The database name cannot be changed while other users are accessing the database. 
  - In SQL Server, you can set a database in single user mode to close any open connections. For more information, see [set the database to single-user mode](../../relational-databases/databases/set-a-database-to-single-user-mode.md).
  - In Azure SQL Database, you must make sure no other users have an open connection to the database to be renamed.
  
### Security  
  
#### Permissions

Requires ALTER permission on the database.  
  
## Rename a database using SQL Server Management Studio

Use the following steps to rename a SQL Server or Azure SQL database using SQL Server Management Studio.
  
1. In **Object Explorer**, connect to your SQL instance.  
  
2. Make sure that there are no open connections to the database. If you are using SQL Server, you can [set the database to single-user mode](../../relational-databases/databases/set-a-database-to-single-user-mode.md) to close any open connections and prevent other users from connecting while you are changing the database name.  
  
3. In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**, right-click the database to rename, and then click **Rename**.  
  
4. Enter the new database name, and then click **OK**.  
  
## Rename a database using Transact-SQL  
  
### To rename a SQL Server database by placing it in single-user mode

Use the following steps to rename a SQL Server database using T-SQL in SQL Server Management Studio including the steps to place the database in single-user mode and, after the rename, place the database back in multi-user mode.
  
1. Connect to the `master` database for your instance.  
2. Open a query window.  
3. Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**. This example changes the name of the `MyTestDatabase` database to `MyTestDatabaseCopy`.
  
   ```sql
   USE master;  
   GO  
   ALTER DATABASE MyTestDatabase SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE
   GO
   ALTER DATABASE MyTestDatabase MODIFY NAME = MyTestDatabaseCopy ;
   GO  
   ALTER DATABASE MyTestDatabaseCopy SET MULTI_USER
   GO
   ```  

### To rename an Azure SQL Database database

Use the following steps to rename an Azure SQL database using T-SQL in SQL Server Management Studio.
  
1. Connect to the `master` database for your instance.  
2. Open a query window.
3. Make sure that no one is using the database.
4. Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**. This example changes the name of the `MyTestDatabase` database to `MyTestDatabaseCopy`.
  
   ```sql
   ALTER DATABASE MyTestDatabase MODIFY NAME = MyTestDatabaseCopy ;
   ```  

## Backup after renaming a database  

After renaming a database in SQL Server, back up the `master` database. In Azure SQL Database, this is not needed as backups occur automatically.
