## sqlpackage on macOS and Linux 0.0.1 (preview)

Release date: May 9, 2018  
Build: 15.0.4057.1

This release contains the cross-platform preview build of sqlpackage that targets .NET Core 2.0, and can run on macOS and Linux. 

This release is an early preview with following known issues:

- The /p:CommandTimeout parameter is hard coded to 120.
- Build and deployment contributors aren't supported.
  - Will be fixed after moving to .NET Core 2.1 where System.ComponentModel.Composition.dll is supported.
  - Need to handle case-sensitive paths.
- SQL CLR UDT types aren't supported, including SQL Server CLR UDT Types: SqlGeography, SqlGeometry, & SqlHierarchyId.
- Older .dacpac and .bacpac files that use json data serialization aren't supported.
- Referenced .dacpacs (for example master.dacpac) may not resolve due to issues with case-sensitive file systems.
  - A workaround is to capitalize the name of the reference file (for example MASTER.BACPAC).
