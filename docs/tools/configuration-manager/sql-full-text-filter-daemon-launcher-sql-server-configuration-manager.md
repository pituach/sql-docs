# SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher (SQL Server Configuration Manager)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]
  Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)], the SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher (FDHOST Launcher) service is used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] full-text search to start the filter daemon host process, which handles full-text search filtering and word breaking. This service must be running to use full-text search. The FDHOST Launcher service is an instance-aware service that is associated with a specific instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The FDHOST Launcher service propagates the service account information to each filter daemon host process started. For information about the filter daemon host processes, see "Full-Text Search Architecture" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.
