# SQL Server help and feedback
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md](../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

We're interested in your ideas for improving our products and documentation. We can't always respond personally, but we'll make sure that your feedback gets to the right person or team. 

## I want to give feedback on SQL Server
The SQL Server engineering team keeps a close eye on the SQL Server [User Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server). If you want to report a problem with SQL Server, such as crashes, sluggish performance, unexpected behavior, and so on, the User Voice is the best place to do that. 

The [User Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server) is also a great place to let the engineering team know what they could do better! If you have any recommendations or feature suggestions, please report it here as well. 

## I want to make a suggestion about SQL Server Management Studio
The SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) team also closely monitors the SQL Server [User Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server) so if you have any issues to report, or suggestions to make, the User Voice is the best place to do so. 

## I want to contact Microsoft Support
