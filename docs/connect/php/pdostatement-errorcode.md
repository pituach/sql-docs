# PDOStatement::errorCode
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

Retrieves the SQLSTATE of the most recent operation on the database statement object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
string PDOStatement::errorCode();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
Returns a five-char SQLSTATE as a string, or NULL if there was no operation on the statement handle.  
  
## Remarks  
Support for PDO was added in version 2.0 of the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)].  
  
## Example  
This example shows a SQL query that has an error.  The error code is then displayed.  
  
```  
<?php  
$conn = new PDO( "sqlsrv:server=(local) ; Database = AdventureWorks", "", "");  
$stmt = $conn->prepare('SELECT * FROM Person.Addressx');  
  
$stmt->execute();  
print $stmt->errorCode();  
?>  
```
