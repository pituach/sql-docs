# Microsoft PHP Drivers for SQL Server Support Matrix
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

  This page contains the support matrix and support lifecycle policy for the Microsoft PHP Drivers for SQL Server.

## Microsoft PHP Drivers Support Lifecycle Matrix and Policy
 The Microsoft Support Lifecycle (MSL) policy provides transparent, predictable information regarding the support lifecycle of Microsoft products. PHP Drivers versions 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x have five years of Mainstream support from the driver release date. Mainstream support is defined on the [Microsoft support lifecycle website](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle).

 Extended and custom support options are not available for the Microsoft PHP Drivers.

 The following Microsoft PHP Drivers are supported, until the indicated End of Support date.

|Driver Name|Driver Package Version|End of Mainstream Support|
|-|-|-|
|Microsoft PHP Drivers 5.2 for SQL Server|5.2|February 9, 2023|
|Microsoft PHP Drivers 4.3 for SQL Server|4.3|July 6, 2022|
|Microsoft PHP Drivers 4.0 for SQL Server|4.0|July 11, 2021|
|Microsoft PHP Drivers 3.2 for SQL Server|3.2|March 9, 2020|
|Microsoft PHP Drivers 3.1 for SQL Server|3.1|December 12, 2019|

 The following Microsoft PHP Drivers are no longer supported.

|Driver Name|Driver Package Version|End of Mainstream Support|
|-|-|-|
|Microsoft PHP Drivers 3.0 for SQL Server|3.0|March 6, 2017|
|Microsoft PHP Drivers 2.0 for SQL Server|2.0|August 10, 2015|
|Microsoft PHP Drivers 1.0 for SQL Server|1.0|April 28, 2014|

## SQL Server Version Certified Compatibility
 The following matrix lists SQL Server versions that have been tested and certified as compatible with the corresponding driver version. We strive to maintain backward compatibility with previous driver versions, but only the latest supported driver is tested and certified with new SQL Server versions as SQL Server is released.
