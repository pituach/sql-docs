# setServerPreparedStatementDiscardThreshold Method (SQLServerConnection)
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

 Specifies the behavior for a specific connection instance. This setting controls how many outstanding prepared statement discard actions (sp_unprepare) can be outstanding per connection before a call to clean up the outstanding handles on the server is executed. When the setting is <= 1 un-prepare actions are executed immediately on prepared statement close. If the value is set to > 1 these calls are batched together to avoid overhead of calling sp_unprepare too often.


## Syntax  
  
```  
  
public void setServerPreparedStatementDiscardThreshold(boolean thresholdValue)  
```  

#### Parameters  
 *thresholdValue*  
 
 The new value of the **serverPreparedStatementDiscardThreshold** connection property.
