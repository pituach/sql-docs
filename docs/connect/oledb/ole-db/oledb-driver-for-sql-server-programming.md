  The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is a low-level COM API that is used for accessing data. The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is recommended for developing tools, utilities, or low-level components that need high performance. The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is a native, high performance provider that accesses the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol directly.  
  
 OLE DB Driver for SQL Server provides OLE DB support to applications connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is an OLE DB version 2.0â€“compliant provider.
