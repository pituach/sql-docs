  When developing an application that uses the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server library, there are a number of issues that come into play. The topics in this section discuss many of these issues including upgrading from MDAC to OLE DB Driver for SQL Server, using the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server header and library files, and an overview of the various connection strings that can be used with OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.  

## In This Section  
 [Installing OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](../../oledb/applications/installing-oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md)  
 Discusses how OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is installed, the locations that various components are installed to, and how to uninstall OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.  

 [Components of OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](../../oledb/applications/components-of-oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md)  
 Discusses the components that make up OLE DB Driver for SQL Server including library, resource, help, and header files.  

 [Using Connection String Keywords with OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](../../oledb/applications/using-connection-string-keywords-with-oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md)  
 Discusses the various types of connection strings that can be used when connecting to a database through OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.  

 [Using the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server Header and Library Files](../../oledb/applications/using-the-oledb-driver-for-sql-server-header-and-library-files.md)  
 Discusses how to use the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server header and library files within an application.  

 [Updating an Application to OLE DB Driver for SQL Server from MDAC](../../oledb/applications/updating-an-application-to-oledb-driver-for-sql-server-from-mdac.md)  
 Discusses the differences between OLE DB Driver for SQL Server and MDAC and issues that should be considered when upgrading from MDAC to OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.  

 [Updating an Application from SQL Server 2005 Native Client](../../oledb/applications/updating-an-application-from-sql-server-2005-native-client.md)  
 Discusses issues that should be considered when upgrading from [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] Native Client to OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.  

 [Using ADO with OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](../../oledb/applications/using-ado-with-oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md)  
 Discusses how ADO can use OLE DB Driver for SQL Server to access and use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] functionality.  

 [Support Policies for OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](../../oledb/applications/support-policies-for-oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md)  
 Discusses how various data-access components can be used with different versions of OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.
