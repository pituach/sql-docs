# OLE DB Driver for SQL Server (OLE DB) Interfaces
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server exposes interfaces to consumers wanting access to data on one or more computers running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is an OLE DB version 2.0â€“compliant provider.  
  
 This OLE DB Driver for SQL Server programming reference does not document all of the OLE DB interfaces and methods, only those interfaces and methods that exhibit provider-specific behavior when using the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.  
  
 For a full description of the core OLE DB interfaces and methods, see the [OLE DB Programmer's Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=45232).
