# Release notes for the Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

This page discusses what was added in each version of the Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.

## What's new in version 18.1.0

**Features added:**

* Support for `UseFMTONLY` connection string keyword and `SSPROP_INIT_USEFMTONLY` initialization property.
`UseFMTONLY` controls how metadata is retrieved when connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and newer.  
For more information, see:
  * [Using Connection String Keywords with OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](applications/using-connection-string-keywords-with-oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md)

**Bugs fixed:**

* Fixed incorrect version of the BCP format file. The OLE DB Driver 18.0 incorrectly sets the version of the BCP format file to 18.0 instead of 11.0. Format files generated by the OLE DB Driver 18.0 cannot be read by the OLE DB Driver 18.1. If you need to use format files generated by the previous version of the driver with the new driver, you can manually edit the files to change the version to 11.0.

## What's new in version 18.0.2

**Features added**:

* Support for `MultiSubnetFailover` connection string keyword and `SSPROP_INIT_MULTISUBNETFAILOVER` initialization property.
