## Azure Samples and templates
There are a number of Microsoft Azure code samples and examples available on Github in .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, PHP and Ruby. Additionally, Azure Resource Manager allows you to provision your applications using a declarative template. In a single template, you can deploy multiple services along with their dependencies. You use the same template to repeatedly deploy your application during every stage of the application lifecycle.
