# Constructing SQL Statements
SQL statements can be constructed in one of three ways: hard-coded during development, constructed at run time, or entered directly by the user.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Hard-Coded SQL Statements](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/hard-coded-sql-statements.md)  
  
-   [SQL Statements Constructed at Run Time](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/sql-statements-constructed-at-run-time.md)  
  
-   [SQL Statements Entered by the User](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/sql-statements-entered-by-the-user.md)
